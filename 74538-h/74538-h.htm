  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This book has been prepared to meet the needs of a
constantly increasing number who for various reasons have
adopted a vegetarian or near vegetarian diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>My experiences first as a nurse, later as a physician, have
brought me in contact with many different nationalities, and
from them has been gleaned much valuable information which
has been used in the hope of aiding all who are earnestly
seeking a safe and sane method of living, simple and rational
methods of using vegetarian foods.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been my special object to eliminate artificial sugar
in the recipes as much as possible, also to pay special attention
to <b>correct chemical food combinations which are as important
as their proper selection and preparation</b>.</p>

<p class='c008'>My endeavor has been to perfect a system of hygienic
feeding which avoids all such mixtures as tend to over-load
the system with excess of starch and soft nitrogenous foods—an
excess which results in malnutrition and dangerous
diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The book is designed for all who do not desire meat in
their bill of fare. It will serve as a handbook for summer
cookery, containing menus and recipes which are in harmony
with the laws of health.</p>

<p class='c008'>In adopting a raw food diet, or in reducing heat-giving
elements, such as artificial sugars and hot drinks, it is
important to apply more external heat to the body for a while,
or else have the morning meal served in a sunny room.
<b>Plenty of outdoor exercise is necessary to properly utilize a
vegetarian diet.</b></p>

<p class='c008'>In the preparation of this volume I have been assisted by
several friends who are interested in the publication of such a
work.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is my hope that this book will be instrumental in
reducing the high cost of living as well as in lessening
women’s work and worry.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c009'>“THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE.”</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'>Its Structure and Function Depend on the Building
Material.</p>

<p class='c008'>Foods are substances which, when introduced into the system,
supply the necessary material for growth, renewal and
maintenance of the vital structures. Food is anything that
nourishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Foods must contain the same elements found in our bodies.
The body requires a combination of different food elements in
proper proportion to produce a suitable diet. Foods are
divided into five classes: water, protein, fats, carbohydrates
and mineral matters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Air and sun are also foods, but are not generally spoken of
as nutrient.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>WATER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Our bodies consist of about two-thirds water. It helps to
regulate the body processes, and supplies building material.
Watery fruits and vegetables contain pure distilled water.
The amount of water required for the average individual differs
greatly. If water is added to our foods in the cooking
process, a lesser amount is required for drinking. Wholesome,
non-stimulating food will call for a normal supply of water
between meals.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pure water is as important as pure food. If you boil your water
the minerals are deposited on the bottom of the kettle instead of in
the system for bone-making material.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PROTEINS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>These are sometimes called albumen, and they supply the
body with nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. They are great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>tissue builders; they also furnish energy and heat, in combination
with fats and carbohydrates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sources of Proteins:</p>

<p class='c008'>Legumes, lean meats, nuts, cheese, whites of eggs, fish, and
the glutens of the grains. Milk contains proteins in the right
proportion with fats and sugars to make it suitable as a food
for infants. Oats, wheat, and rye contain more protein than
other grains, and if no other protein foods are on hand, these
can maintain health for a long time without harm.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FATS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>They are obtained from the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
They supply heat and energy in the most concentrated
form, and are also flesh-builders. In diseased conditions, where
economy of nerve force is required, fats in combination with
acids, minerals and gelatine can form a substitute for part of
the protein foods.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CARBOHYDRATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>These are found in large percentage in cereals and in fruits
which contain stones and seeds, and in underground vegetables,
including the lighter starches, such as sago, agar agar,
sea moss and gum. Milk can serve as a carbohydrate for
special conditions, being evenly proportioned with fats and
protein it contains little waste. A certain amount of carbohydrate
foods in the form of cereals is necessary in our daily
diet, as they are rich in lime and fat—yielding material which
is required for ligamentous and other elastic tissue. People
who live on fruits, greens and nuts, or on fruits, greens and
meats only, require a larger amount of protein food, in order
to make up for the loss of cereals.</p>

<p class='c012'>Teach a growing child that selecting and preparing his food is an
important occupation. Do not allow a child to fill his body with trash.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MINERAL MATTER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In an organic form, we find mineral matter in large proportions
in green leaf vegetables, small fruits and berries, bran,
rye, green peas, string beans, tomatoes, yolks of eggs and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>all the outer skins of legumes, grains and fruits. The importance
of the mineral elements in our foods has been little understood,
so far. Of late, health reformers are beginning to realize
that many serious diseases, such as tuberculosis, insanity
and malnutrition, are the result of mineral starvation. Three-fourths
of these valuable minerals are removed from our foods
daily by modern milling, bleaching, and polishing of rice,
wheat, corn and all the other grains. Not alone the minerals,
but necessary volatile oils, acids, and ferments are removed by
these processes. Refined white flour and sugar have been
on the market for the last hundred years; and much time and
health have been wasted with the writing of fashionable cook
books, and the manufacture of anemic snow white cakes, crackers,
biscuits and soft putrefying puddings and desserts, prepared
with skim milk, sugar and eggs. The deficiency of
minerals in these products has created an abnormal desire for
salts, spices, and chemically pure sugar, followed by an additional
craving for intoxicating beverages and liquors. The
latter articles cannot enter into the composition of perfect
teeth and bone, or gray nervous tissue; therefore, the result
is premature death and many new diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is my desire to present in this book food combinations
as perfect as can be produced from food material with
our present methods of milling and preliminary treatment.
Many people have become so delicate in structure that they
cannot use coarse breads and cereals; therefore, a variety of
different cereal foods have been included. Vegetable foods,
such as are rich in minerals, have been added to the breakfast
foods in place of sugar and beverages. In order to supply the
body with the necessary amount of minerals, we must learn to
eat greens for breakfast, until our so-called breakfast foods
have improved in quality.</p>

<p class='c012'>Keep the feet warm, the head cool and the stomach not too full.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take walks out of doors daily and breathe deeply.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do not wear tight shoes or corsets.</p>

<p class='c007'>All foods possess potential or latent energy. The sun is the
great positive element, and plants store up the sun’s energy.
It is transferred to us through the eating of plants and animal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>foods. Through the process of oxidation this energy is set
free in our bodies, and appears as heat and muscular power.
This energy contained in foods is known as heat or fuel value,
and is expressed in terms of a heat unit or calorie. A calorie
is the amount of heat necessary to raise one kilogram of water,
one degree centigrade. This is spoken of as a large calorie,
which is used in determining the energy value of food. The
small calorie is ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of a large calorie.</p>

<p class='c008'>The physiological fuel and energy value of the different
foods is as follows:</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>1 gram of Protein</td>
    <td class='c015'>yields 4 Calories</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>1 gram of Fat</td>
    <td class='c015'>yields 9 Calories</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>1 gram of Carbohydrates</td>
    <td class='c015'>yields 4 Calories</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>To determine the energy value of a food or combination of
foods it is necessary to know first its composition. Then determine
the weight of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in grams
and multiply these weights accordingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many people are under the impression that if a certain food is recommended
as especially healthful, over-indulgence must be beneficial. All
natural foods are wholesome; over-eating produces discomfort and disease.
Some fruits and vegetables have high medicinal values. Specific foods
prescribed in large quantities are useful for certain ailments, but not
for a healthy individual.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some people think that we become like the food we eat. This is
true when the vibrations of what we eat are stronger than the vibrations
in our bodies. All food consumed has a vibration of its own and unless
the vital force within can change the rate of vibration of the food eaten
and tune it to the vibration of the body itself, one cannot become
nourished, or in other words “he becomes like the food he eats.” There
is but one force or energy in the body, which is life or “spirit”. Under
normal conditions this force has in itself all the power to harmonize with
the vibrations of the foods taken into the body. Provided there is a
demand for food in the form of true hunger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Natural diet, deep rythmic breathing with corresponding exercises
awaken latent talents within us and rapid mental and spiritual unfoldment
takes place. Inharmony, disease and pain are caused by living
a life contrary to the laws of God and Nature.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c009'>PREPARATION OF FOODS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>TABLE OF MEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.</p>

<p class='c012'>A standard measuring cup contains 8 ounces or ½-pint.</p>

<p class='c013'>1 tablespoon is equal to 3 teaspoons.</p>

<p class='c013'>2 tablespoons is equal to 1 ounce.</p>

<p class='c013'>8 tablespoons is equal to 4 ounces or ½-cup.</p>

<p class='c013'>16 tablespoons is equal to 8 ounces or 1 cup.</p>

<p class='c013'>All ingredients measured by the cup, tablespoon or teaspoon are
measured level.</p>

<p class='c013'>1 pound (English weight) is equal to 425 grams or 16 ounces.</p>

<p class='c013'>1 pound (Metric system) is equal to 500 grams.</p>

<p class='c013'>2 pounds (Metric system) is equal to 1000 grams, or 1 kilogram.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>GREEN VEGETABLES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Green vegetables furnish a large amount of easily digested
carbohydrates and contain much mineral matter. That they
add to the highest purity of our blood has been proven by the
fact that many blood and skin diseases have been cured by the
application of specific greens alone. However, no matter how
valuable an article is, it should be used according to the needs
of the individual. As vegetables also contain a large amount
of water, it is not wise for one who has to perform active
mental or physical labor to indulge in a large amount of
cooked, especially underground, vegetables at the noon meal.
At this time of the day the system requires the most nutritious
foods in the form of protein elements, no matter whether the
meal consists of cooked food, cold or warmed over. Green
peas and corn are best eaten at the noon meal, as they are rich
in proteid elements. Asparagus, tomatoes, string beans and
leaf greens are also suitable at this time of the day, provided
some nutritious food of the proteid class is served with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blanching of vegetables, as advised by some authorities,
will always remove valuable constituents of the plant. This
blanching and ventilation of vegetables during the process of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>cooking is advised, in order to make them more wholesome.
All artificially prepared foods will lose certain constituents
through the process of cooking, and this loss is generally made
up by additional flavoring or sauces. Vegetables which are
cooked in very little water and kept well covered (not ventilated),
will lose less of their natural qualities, and the injurious
gases which do not escape by this process can be made
harmless through the addition of fats, in the emulsified form,
as sauces, the yolk of an egg, lemon or cream.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the consumption of food, as well as the custom of dress
and education, some people have reached that stage of refinement
where degeneration begins. We cannot refine natural food
without paying the penalty for it.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GREEN VEGETABLES.</h4>

<h4 class='c016'>ARTICHOKES. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash them thoroughly and remove the outside leaves.
Drop into salted boiling water and cook for 20 or 30 minutes.
Add a few drops of vinegar to the water while boiling. Serve
warm with a white sauce or let cool and serve with French or
mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ARTICHOKES. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing; when tender put them into a
deep bowl and squeeze diluted lemon juice over them, or
use vinegar diluted with one half or third water. Let stand
in sufficient liquid to cover the hearts well for 10 or 20 minutes.
Serve with a white sauce or with French or mayonnaise
dressing. Wheat or rye bread with butter is a good addition,
also dried stewed fruit. If served for dinner, boiled eggs or
egg-food of some kind should be added. If soup is desired,
pea, tomato or milk soup is the most suitable. Olives also
form a good addition.</p>

<p class='c012'>People who suffer from obesity, or those who can not use much
sweets, should always treat cooked vegetables (except potatoes) with
acid as mentioned above. The volatile oils and bitter preservative
qualities in vegetables evaporate in the process of cooking, leaving it
with a sweetish taste, and making it more liable to ferment.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ASPARAGUS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and cut into inch pieces until the hard part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the stem is reached. Boil for 20 minutes, or until tender.
Serve warm with butter, milk, cream, or egg sauce, or cold
with French or mayonnaise dressing. The asparagus may be
scraped and tied into bundles when boiling.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BEETS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the green tops and wash them carefully. Do not
prick the skin, as the juice will then escape and injure the
color as well as the flavor. Young beets will be tender in
about one hour, older ones take two or three hours. When
done, peel and slice. Serve with a butter or cream sauce, or
plain, with butter and chopped parsley. For salad, cut into
slices and pour over them boiling vinegar, diluted with one-half
water. Add whole spices if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MASHED BEETS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the above. When tender, peel and mash very
fine with a potato masher, and add butter and a few drops of
lemon juice.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ROASTED CARROTS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash, scrape, and cut them lengthwise into halfs and quarters,
then cut crosswise into inch pieces or smaller. Cover
with boiling water and cook for 10 or 15 minutes, with a little
salt. Drain off the water (add to soups); brown some fat and
flour, add to it whey or the water which was drained off,
and roast the carrots in it until done. Cover them tightly and
add more fluid while roasting, if necessary. Flavor with
chopped parsley.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CARROT PUREE. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Steam or cook the carrots with salt and as little water as
possible. When done, mash very fine with a potato masher.
Flavor with butter and a little pepper and parsley or lemon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Legumes and carrots with lettuce salad are a good combination.
Crackers or black bread with lettuce salad and beets or carrots. Nuts
for dessert are a fair combination. People with a bilious temperament
should not combine cooked beets or carrots with cheese or eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CARROT PUREE. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the above, and add one potato to three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>medium sized carrots. If the potatoes require less time to
cook, add them when the carrots are half done. This preparation
may be especially recommended for chronic invalids or for
those who have a dislike for the sweet flavor of the vegetable.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAMED CARROTS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook like carrot puree. When tender, make a butter sauce
with the water; add parsley and hot cream, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAMED CARROTS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook like number one, thicken with flour or corn starch,
and add some hot cream and parsley. Serve, like soup or
vegetables, for breakfast or supper, with dry whole wheat or
black bread. Butter is not required at the meal if cream is
used. If the butter and cream are emulsified as in sauces,
they are more wholesome.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEAS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash the peas while in the pods, then shell. Boil the pods
in a very little water for 15 minutes, then take out and put the
peas to boil in the same water. Add a little salt and sugar
when almost done. Prepare further like creamed carrots.
Some people prefer them with no dressing except butter.
Those who have difficulty in digesting starch and wish to cut
out the bread at the meal may use sauces or cream dressings
with their vegetables, especially in the winter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MIXED PEAS AND CARROTS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the peas on to boil, and when half done, add an equal
amount of carrots which have been cut into half inch pieces.
Prepare with a butter sauce like creamed carrots, and add
chopped parsley. This will afford a perfect meal for dinner in
spring or summer. A few bread or flour dumplings may be
served with it. The latter should be cooked with the peas 10
minutes before serving.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lima beans and green peas are more suitable during warm weather
than small white or colored beans. Dark colored beans and lentils are
rich in iron and minerals and therefore best suitable during cold days.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>CAULIFLOWER.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Cauliflower should be avoided by those who have delicate
stomachs, at the evening meal. It should be perfectly fresh
and put into salted water for an hour before cooking, in order
to take out any hidden insects. It should be boiled 20 to 30
minutes; if steamed it takes a little longer. Flavor with salt
and a little sugar while boiling. Serve with brown or melted
butter and lemon, or butter sauce, or with cream. Season
with pepper. Serve for breakfast, or dinner. Left over cauliflower
may be baked in the oven with cheese or bread crumbs,
and served for breakfast. Tomato sauce is also suitable as
a dressing. Cold cheese is a better combination with the latter
than cream sauce or baked cheese.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STRING BEANS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>They are very purifying and should be eaten often, by people
of a bilious tendency. Select young string beans, pull off
the string on each side and break in pieces an inch long. Boil
in slightly salted water and prepare like green peas. They
may be mixed with carrots. For further combinations, see
“Boiled Mixed Dinners.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SPINACH.</h4>

<p class='c011'>This is also a very valuable vegetable. Besides being rich
in iron and phosphates, it is laxative, and excellent as a medicinal
food for constipation. Wash it thoroughly. For a delicate
stomach use the leaves only. Steep in as little water as possible,
chop very fine or rub through a colander; season with
pepper, salt, lemon and butter, or prepare with butter sauce.</p>

<p class='c012'>String beans resemble the green leaf vegetables. They are very
purifying to the liver and intestines, and should be eaten freely by
people with a bilious temperament.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut off the stem end and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers
with a dressing such as is given in recipes for bread dumplings.
Place them in a baking dish with two tablespoonfuls of
oil or fat; when brown add a little flour and water, cover the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>dish and bake in an oven for about 50 minutes. The inner part
of the peppers may be mixed with a filling.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ONIONS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>For stewing use small or medium sized onions. Boil them
in salt water, drain off the water and serve with butter and
lemon, or prepare a butter or cream sauce. They are best eaten
for breakfast or dinner with wheat or rye bread.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RAW ONIONS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>People who like onions and find they disagree on account
of the strong acids, should grate them and mix thoroughly with
sauces, or French or mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRIED ONIONS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Chop the onions very fine in a wooden bowl. Then heat
some butter and oil and fry them until light brown and pour
over steak or mix with potatoes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PARSLEY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Chop enough to last for several days. Melt some butter
and add the parsley, and let boil up once. When cold put on
ice. This saves time, though it is best to prepare the parsley
fresh for each meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MUSHROOMS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and dry them, then roll in flour and fry in fat until
brown. Add some soup stock and steep until done. Cover
well. If the stock is too thin, add a little browned flour; season
and serve on toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COOKED CORN.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Steam the ears until tender. Serve with tomato or with
potato and apple puree.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mushrooms prepared in any style form a good combination with egg
foods. Honey and sweet dried fruits are too rich in carbon to serve at
the same meal with egg foods. Oranges, cherries, green grapes, dried
apricots, cranberries, or rhubarb compote are suitable for dessert when
egg foods are used. If raw berries are desired they should be eaten
at the beginning of the meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CANNED CORN.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Thicken the corn with flour and water. Add a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>amount of hot cream and season with salt and pepper or a few
spoonfuls of tomato juice. If no cream is desired, drain off
the liquid and thicken like butter sauce. Canned corn, being
a rich and soft food, should not be mixed with many other
foods at the same meal. It is more suitable for the morning
or noon meal than for supper.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>KOHLRABI.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel, slice thin, and stew in a very little water. When
nearly done, add some hot soup. Prepare with a butter sauce.
Chop fine some green leaves of the plant previously boiled
and add.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and cut in quarters. Mince very fine and put on to
boil in a little water with salt. When tender, drain off the
water and prepare a butter sauce for it; mix with the cabbage,
flavor with lemon, mace or pepper and serve with hard boiled
eggs. If a cream sauce is desired, thicken the cabbage with
a little corn starch dissolved in cold water, let boil a few minutes
then add the cream. Milk may be used instead of
cream, or with the butter sauce but is not to be recommended
for people with intestinal indigestion.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RED CABBAGE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing. Let it boil for twenty minutes
in an earthenware dish, then add three to five ounces of oil,
a few tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of sugar, a little salt and
caraway seed. Let all simmer slowly for several hours. A
few tart apples may be cooked with it to flavor the cabbage.
The apples may be removed when done, and can be served
for breakfast. Thicken the cabbage with a little brown flour.
Flavor with onion if desired.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cabbage is rich in minerals. It can be made very indigestible by
careless preparation. Raw cabbage is easily digested if chopped very
fine and mixed with grated potato and mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE WITH TOMATO SAUCE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and cut into quarters, and cook in a very little water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>When done prepare a tomato sauce and pour over the cabbage,
or serve plain with butter or oil.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SAUERKRAUT WITH DUMPLINGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash the sauerkraut in cold water several times. For
people with sensitive stomachs boil it for a short time; then
drain off the water and boil again. Cook from one to two
hours. Then add butter and flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SAUERKRAUT SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash several times in cold water, press out dry and mix
with French or mayonnaise dressing. It may be chopped
fine if desired. Serve with eggs or beans.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>VEGETABLE OYSTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash, scrape and boil in salt water until tender—about 40
minutes. Prepare with butter, milk or cream sauce, or mash
fine and fry like potato balls. Season with lemon or pepper.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TURNIP PUREE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like carrot puree. Cook with as little water as
possible.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRIED PARSNIPS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Scrape, wash and cut in slices, lengthwise. Boil in salt
water for 5 minutes, then drain and fry in smoking hot fat.
They can be turned in batter if desired. They may be fried
without cooking, like sweet potatoes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>KALE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>This is a desirable vegetable in cold weather. It is purifying
and very valuable during the rainy season, in malarial
districts. Remove the leaves from the stems, wash and boil in
salt water, using as little water as possible. Chop very fine
and prepare like spinach.</p>

<p class='c012'>Spinach is also a very valuable vegetable. Besides being rich in
iron and phosphates, it is laxative, and excellent as a medicinal food
for constipation. Wash it thoroughly. For a delicate stomach use the
leaves only. Steep it in as little water as possible, chop very fine or
rub through a colander; season with pepper, salt, lemon and butter, or
prepare with a butter sauce.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>SQUASH.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If young and tender it does not require peeling. Wash,
cut into small pieces and steam. When done, mash fine and
season with salt, pepper and cream, or butter, and a few drops
of lemon. It may be cut in slices and fried in oil, or dipped in
butter and fried like egg plant.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOMATO PUREE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut some fresh, firm tomatoes into several pieces. Cook in
a double boiler with as little water as possible. Rub through
a sieve with a spoon or potato masher. From 3 to 6 ounces of
thick puree is sufficient at a meal, for the average adult. For
medicinal purposes, tomatoes may be eaten in large quantities.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CANNED STEWED TOMATOES. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>They are more wholesome if not cooked. Place a can of
tomatoes in hot water to heat, drain off the liquid, and serve.
The liquid may be kept for soup.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEWED TOMATOES. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Heat a can of tomatoes, thicken with flour and water, and
let boil 10 minutes. Add some butter and flavor with onion,
and small amount of sugar if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEWED TOMATOES. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as number two, thicken with bread or cracker
crumbs, instead of flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEWED TOMATOES. No. 4.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Heat a can of tomatoes. Then heat some butter and oil in
a flat saucepan, thicken with mixed flour, flavor with onion,
add gradually, and let boil a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The tomato stimulates peristalsis and is a wonderful tonic. It
contains a vegetable calomel and serves as a purifier for the liver in
bilious conditions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SWEET POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil the potatoes in the jackets, let cool, peel, slice, and fry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in one-half butter and one-half oil. Serve with cranberry
sauce. Sweet potatoes may be peeled and sliced in the raw
state, and fried in half oil and half butter. Serve as above.
They are very suitable for breakfast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAMED POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Select small potatoes and boil in the skins. Add some salt.
When done, peel and cut into thin slices. Bring some milk
to a boil, and thicken with corn starch dissolved in water, or
prepare a butter sauce with butter, flour and milk. Add the
potatoes and some finely chopped parsley.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CRUST POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use small, imported German potatoes. Boil with the
skins, peel and turn in yolk of eggs and rye nuts; fry in oil
and butter. Serve with sprouts, or spinach and eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEAMED POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel small sized potatoes, wash and put into a steamer or
colander. When done pour into a dish, and mix with chopped
parsley and fresh butter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRENCH FRIED POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel and cut into long strips or thin slices. Put into salt
water on ice for half an hour. Fry in boiling oil.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MASHED POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel, wash, and boil or steam the potatoes; when done,
mash fine, and add some hot cream or cold buttermilk, and
a little salt, also a piece of butter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MASHED SWEET POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as white potatoes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>POTATO BALLS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat 2 eggs with an egg beater, mix with one cup of left-over
mashed potatoes, shape into balls and fry in hot fat.</p>

<p class='c012'>If certain foods do not agree, or produce indigestion, study their combination
and preparation carefully, also the proportion and time of the
day when most suitable. If this does not prove satisfactory, leave them
alone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>POTATO PUDDING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as potato balls. Put the mass into a pudding
dish and cover with rye nuts, grated cheese, or a beaten
egg mixed with rye nuts, and bake for an hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Potatoes consist mainly of starch and water. They are more expensive
than wheat, rye, oats, barley and corn. They should not be
eaten oftener than once a day, or better three times a week. People who
do hard physical or mental work should not eat potatoes at the noon
meal. Fats, eggs, cheese and greens combine well with potatoes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Baked potatoes or tomatoes form a good addition with cabbage. For
proteins use hard boiled eggs or any variety of beans either baked, in
the form of soup, or as a roast. Potatoes and tomatoes should not be
mixed at the same meal unless a liberal amount of fat is served at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cooked foods which have poor keeping qualities should not be kept
for further use, or no more should be prepared than can be eaten at one
meal. To this class belong cooked underground or leaf vegetables,
custards, soft puddings, milk and egg foods and gelatines. Damp or
rainy weather is more favorable for decomposition of foodstuffs than
dry weather. If a variety of left-over food is on hand which cannot be
combined into one dish, it is better to serve different food to each
member rather than to divide each article for all; the latter custom may
be more polite, but it is not wise to mix a great variety of foods at
one meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Left-over potatoes can be utilized in many different ways: for pancakes,
potato dumplings, creamed potatoes or for salad. Fried cooked
potatoes are not a good food for the noon meal, especially for children
or people doing active work.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c009'>LEGUMES, EGGS, AND CHEESE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>LEGUMES.</p>

<p class='c008'>Legumes lose their natural flavor and stimulus in the
process of drying and cooking, therefore they are not palatable
or as easy to digest without some form of fat and an appetizing
raw salad, fruit or soup, which supplies the needed stimulant
to the system. Apples, lemons, grapes, oranges, carrots,
celery and lettuce are most suitable as an addition. Many
people add sweets to legumes or make them more indigestible
by adding ground nuts and other rich foods. Such foods are
a dangerous burden to a weak stomach and liver. Heavy
protein foods require an acid medium for proper digestion
and utilization. If legumes are used in the form of soups and
purees, nothing should be added but a little flour, dry toast,
fats, or raw vegetables.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED BEANS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Pick over the beans carefully, wash and soak them in soft
water. Bring to a boil in the same water, simmer slowly
until the beans are tender and the fluid is nearly absorbed.
If necessary add more water during the process of boiling.
When done, pour them into a beanpot or round pan, cover
the top with cooking oil and a few whole onions. Bake about
an hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Baked legumes if preserved with fat or oil can be kept on hand for
a week and be re-baked two or three times per week.</p>

<p class='c013'>One-third to one-fourth of beans (measured before soaking) is sufficient
for one meal for the average person under ordinary conditions.
Masticate two or three beans at a time to insure good digestion.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED LENTILS OR PEAS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare in the same manner as baked beans, use less fat for
preparing them, especially during the summer. Onions and
celery roots are rich in fatty substance. These may be added
to the legumes while boiling, and be made into a salad for
another meal. In cooking legumes it is best not to add the
salt until they are nearly done as the salt hardens the water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>If legumes are prepared boiled instead of baked it is better
to add a thickening of flour and butter before serving, otherwise
they may produce flatulent dyspepsia.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIMA BEANS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak some lima beans in soft water. Cook in a small
amount of water with a little salt. When tender, dissolve
some cornstarch with cold water and add to the beans; boil
for 10 minutes, then add a few tablespoonfuls of hot cream
and remove from the fire. Flavor with chopped parsley, if
desired. Mashed or raw carrots are a good addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIMA BEANS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and add
a piece of butter, the yolk of an egg, a little lemon juice and
parsley, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIMA BEANS. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and prepare
a butter sauce, mix with beans and serve plain, or add
the yolk of an egg, a little lemon and parsley.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEA PUREE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak ¾ cup of dried green peas in soft water. Boil with
1 quart of water and 1 onion for about an hour. Bake in a
beanpot for 1½ hours or longer; add more water if necessary.
Keep the peas covered. When done run through a colander
and add 1 teaspoonful of butter. This makes about ¾ of a
cup of puree. One-third of this portion is sufficient for a sick
person or a young child. Serve on toast, or with raw carrots.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BEAN AND LENTIL PUREE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare and serve like the foregoing. If a soup is desired
in place of puree, dilute one-third of a cup of puree with one
and a half of boiling water and finish as in legume soup.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dried beans contain more of the protein than peas, lentils or beef.
They are therefore a very rich food and should not be consumed in
large quantities. In countries where the water is hard, it is well to
have soft water on hand for the cooking of legumes. If rain water
cannot be obtained, boil a kettle of water each day and set aside to
cool for cooking purposes. Legumes may be soaked with hot or cold
water.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>RAW BEANS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Soak one tablespoonful of white beans or twelve to twenty
lima beans in soft warm water for four hours or over night.
Serve plain with tomatoes or carrots and green leaves or
prepare in the form of a salad. Onions and parsley are also
good additions. No more than the above measure should be
used for one person at a meal. People with digestive troubles
or those who can not live out of doors, should leave raw
legumes alone.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SOFT BOILED EGGS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the eggs into cold water, place on the stove, and
let come to a boil slowly. When the water begins to boil
the eggs will be done.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOILED EGGS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Pour boiling water over them and let stand on a stove
for 10 to 20 minutes. Boiling will make the albumen of the
egg harder to digest.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRIED EGGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Have the frying pan very hot. Set it back and pour in
some olive oil, then break in the eggs and cover. Let them
harden slowly. Serve with apple or tomato rice or with cooked
or raw starchy or leaf vegetables, except beets or carrots,
unless they are pickled.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED EGGS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Pour whites of eggs on an oiled tin and place in a moderate
oven or over steam until firm. Serve with any kind of
vegetable or a salad of tart fruits.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED EGGS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff snow, add a little
salt, mix with two tablespoonfuls of sifted bran and with
two of fine rye nuts. Pour on an oiled tin, bake and serve
as number one.</p>

<p class='c012'>Scrambled Eggs No. 3 are preferable for people with gastric disturbance.
Nos. 1 and 2 are recommended for people with intestinal
weakness. All soft watery nitrogenous foods are more liable to ferment
before they reach the intestines than those to which flour is added.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>SAXON SOOL EGGS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Pour boiling water on the eggs and let them stand for 20
minutes on a hot stove, or boil the eggs 10 minutes. Lay in
cold water for a few minutes, crack the shells well; place
them for four hours or longer in a strong salt solution, which
must contain so much salt that the eggs will swim. Prepare
as follows: Bring a quart of water to a boil, dissolve about
one cupful or more of salt, let boil a few minutes and cool.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ESCALOPED EGGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil or set some eggs until hard. Cut into halves or quarters
and pour over them a butter sauce flavored with horseradish,
capers or mustard. Serve with baked potatoes and
string beans or sprouts. If the butter sauce is prepared with
tomato juice, serve wheat bread or crackers with them instead
of potatoes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PICKLED EGGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil or set some eggs until hard. Then boil one pint of
vinegar with a pint of water and a little salt and pour into
a deep earthen dish, add some whole peppers and bay leaves.
Remove the shells from the eggs and place them in the pickle.
Tie up with paper, let stand for a week or longer. These eggs
are a good addition to sandwiches or can be served with
salads or green leaves, olives, apples, tomatoes, asparagus
or cabbage.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Break the yolks and whites into separate bowls. Add one
teaspoonful of flour to each yolk of egg and also a little salt.
Beat with an egg beater until smooth, then add as many
tablespoonfuls of cold water as there are eggs and beat again.
Add the snow of the whites and pour into a large frying pan,
in which some oil or fat has been heated. Stir constantly
until all is solid. Serve with potatoes or toast and green
vegetables.</p>

<p class='c012'>People who have difficulty in digesting eggs will find it more agreeable
to eat the yolks and whites at different times of the day. The former
prepared in salad dressing or boiled custards; the latter in the form of
baked eggs with lemon and green vegetables.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as the foregoing. Use a double amount
or more of water or milk or cream, also more flour if desired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Mixed flour is preferable to pure white flour. If eggs are
expensive serve a milk or green pea soup as entree and use
less eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat yolks and whites separately. Add as many tablespoonfuls
of water or milk or cream as there are eggs. Omit
the flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut left-over potatoes into small pieces or slice; fry them
in half butter and half oil until brown. Then prepare a
batter as directed for scrambled eggs, pour over the potatoes
and stir until the egg is firm. If the flavor of onion is
desired, add a few, finely chopped, and brown in butter in a
separate pan; when done, mix with the eggs and potatoes
and serve. Flavor with pepper, if desired. String beans and
black toast make a good addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a batter as directed for scrambled eggs, add
tomato juice or tomato puree instead of milk or water. Flavor
with grated onion and celery salt. Serve with bread and
green vegetables.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OMELET.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as scrambled eggs No. 1 and 2. Do
not stir. Cover and set in a moderate oven or on back of
stove. When firm remove the cover and brown in oven.
Serve with tart fruit sauce or with apple and lettuce salad,
prepared with French or mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COTTAGE CHEESE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put some whole, or skim milk, into a pan and set in a cool
room, which has plenty of fresh air. Do not cover the pan.
If the room is exposed to dust, put a few long sticks over the
pan and cover with a cheese-cloth. When the milk begins to
get thick, set the pan into a larger pan with warm water, and
keep it in a warm place or in the oven until the curd separates;
it must not become hard. Then put a cheese-cloth on a
colander and pour the milk into it. Let stand for several
hours, until the whey is thoroughly drained off. Then chop
fine some green peppers or onions, mix with the cheese, add
a little salt and pepper, and serve with apple or potato salad
or spread on sandwiches. A few teaspoonfuls of sugar and
caraway seed may be added in place of the onion and pepper.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>MISCELLANEOUS DISHES.</span></h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>IRISH STEW.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Let a quart of water come to a boil; add 10 to 12 pearl
onions, two bay leaves, a teaspoonful of salt and a few whole
black peppers or the skin of green peppers. When the onions
are nearly done, add six small potatoes, let all simmer slowly
until the potatoes are tender; then blend a spoonful of flour
with some butter or oil, add the broth gradually. Cut five
Saxon Sool eggs into halves, mix with the butter sauce and
let stand in a warm place for ten minutes or until the eggs
are warmed through. Then add the cooked vegetables and
plenty of chopped parsley. Serve on a large platter. A tablespoonful
of horseradish or French mustard added to the
butter sauce gives it a pleasant flavor. In place of the butter
sauce, the broth may be thickened with a little corn starch
dissolved in water and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream
used in place of butter. The above quantity is sufficient for
a family of three. The most suitable cooked vegetable served
with this dish is string beans. People who have to live on
an economical plan can add one cup of hot milk to the
broth and prepare more sauce. In this way the protein in the
milk can serve as a substitute for two eggs. If bread is desired,
serve it at the end of the meal. Toast is preferable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Do not keep a tight cover on a dish, jar or bottle which contains
raw or cooked food, unless the air within is sterile. Allow cooked food
to stand open until it is cool, then put the cover over two-thirds of its
opening or cover with a cheese-cloth or colander.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DUMPLINGS WITH POTATOES AND PRUNES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Steam the potatoes. Prepare some nutritious dumplings
from flour or bread with eggs. Heat some butter or oil, add
finely chopped onions, fry until brown, remove from the
fire and add two tablespoonfuls of syrup and some lemon
juice or vinegar. Pour the potatoes and dumplings on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>dish, mix with stewed cold or warm prunes, pour the syrup
sauce over it, and serve. The syrup sauce can be thickened
with flour and strengthened with the water in which the
dumplings have been cooked; the prune juice can be added
in place of the syrup. Good during summer. Dried pears
or string beans may be substituted for the prunes, or a lettuce
or string bean salad served with it. Macaroni or noodles
may be used in place of dumplings. Growing children or
those who work hard, not finding this meal satisfying, may
drink some milk or eat nuts at the end of the meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIMA BEANS WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak one pound of lima beans in rain or soft water over
night, cook for half an hour, add salt, and then add five good
sized carrots cut to the size of the beans. Cook both for half
an hour, then add four or five potatoes and cook all together
until done. Thicken the broth with corn starch, add chopped
parsley and butter. A tablespoonful of vinegar and sugar
may be added to the sauce if the flavor is desired. The carrots
may be cooked by themselves; when done, add the water to
the beans and potatoes, pour a little diluted vinegar over the
carrots, let stand 20 minutes, drain off the vinegar and add the
carrots to the beans and potatoes. This is preferable for
people who dislike the sweet taste of the carrots. Bread is
not needed at this meal, as potatoes and carrots furnish sufficient
carbohydrates. If bread is desired, it should be eaten
in place of dessert with a little unsweetened black coffee or
malt coffee.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SMALL WHITE OR BROWN BEANS WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as above. Time for cooking depends on the
quality. Do not add the carrots until the beans are nearly
done.</p>

<p class='c012'>The recipes for mixed boiled dinners consisting of legumes, carrots
and potatoes are more wholesome and nutritious than a meal consisting
of potatoes and vegetables each cooked in water and served with yeast bread,
sweets, or rich soft nitrogenous foods.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEAS WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as the foregoing. Young green peas or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>string beans may be used in place of dried peas. This furnishes
an excellent combination during the summer for those
who prefer cooked food.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GREEN PEAS WITH DUMPLINGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a flour dough for dumplings. Boil them in salted
water or in the liquid of the peas. If the peas are desired
in soup form, boil the dumplings in the soup and omit thickening.
Use one-third to one-fifth of a cup of dried peas for
each person, according to size, age and occupation of the
individual. This makes a perfect meal for dinner. The
peas and dumplings furnish sufficient protein and starch;
the fat can be added to the dough of the dumplings.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SUCCOTASH.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook lima beans until tender, add one cup of corn (canned
or scraped from the cob) to two cups of lima beans. Let
both come to a boil, thicken with a little corn starch which
has been dissolved in cold water, season with celery salt or
pepper and serve. Do not serve yeast bread or potatoes at
this meal. Thoroughly toasted bread, green leaf salad and
tomato puree are good additions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LENTILS WITH ONIONS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak a cup of lentils in soft water. Cook or stew in a
double boiler, when nearly done add ten to twelve onions
and salt. Let simmer slowly, when done thicken with a little
corn starch, add a piece of butter and serve with tomato puree
or with a salad of green leaves and raw tomatoes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Green peas are richer in minerals than yellow peas, beans or lentils,
the protein being in the form of legumin and easier to digest. They
are very purifying.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MIXED VEGETABLES (Leipsiger Allerlie).</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use asparagus tops, young French carrots, peas, and cauliflower.
Cook each vegetable separately with salt, in as little
water as possible. When done, drain the water from each
and use for soup. Mix the different vegetables in one dish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and pour browned butter over them. Serve with eggs. A
butter sauce may be prepared from the vegetable water in
place of brown butter. Bread or flour dumplings may be
served with it.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE WITH RICE. (Jewish Dish.)</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the outside leaves from a firm head of cabbage,
cut into halves and quarters and let stand in salted water
for half an hour. Then put into boiling salted water and cook
for about 20 minutes. Wash a cupful of rice and add, cover
and let simmer slowly until all is done. There should be
plenty of water on the cabbage for the rice to swell, so that it
will not become sticky. About 2 quarts for a medium sized
head of cabbage. Some people prefer to cook it with a tablespoonful
of sugar. When ready to serve add a piece of butter,
and pour all on a large platter. Do not eat yeast bread with
it. Drink fresh milk or eat walnuts at the end of the meal.
If bread is desired, use toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE ROLLS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash some large cabbage leaves. Fill them with dough
mixed with eggs. (See recipe for bread dumplings). Then
tie the rolls together with a string. Steam in a shallow
dish with as little water as possible. Serve with a butter or
tomato sauce and hard boiled eggs. Flavor with mace.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>POTATO STEW. (Poor Man’s Bill of Fare.)</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil some steel cut oats or pearl barley as directed for
gruel (See Page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>); when nearly done add some medium
sized potatoes and a little more salt. When the potatoes are
tender, put them into a deep bowl, strain the gruel and pour
it over the potatoes. Add a piece of butter or prepare a little
sauce and mix with the gruel. Flavor with chopped parsley
or onion. Good additions are: black toast, bran crackers,
string beans, sprouts or kale. Oranges or apples for dessert,
if desired.</p>

<p class='c012'>The amount of fat required for a meal depends much on the season
of the year, the occupation and the individual peculiarities, therefore
it must be left to the consideration of the housewife. All legumes
(except peanuts) are poor in fat. A glass of fresh milk is a fairly good
addition with mixed boiled dinners, especially for the growing child.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>MACARONI WITH PEA SAUCE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Boil macaroni in salted water until quite soft; put into a
colander. Prepare a pea sauce from the water which is
drained from the macaroni, add left-over pea puree or dried
pea meal. Serve over the macaroni. If the flavor of onion is
desired, boil one onion with the macaroni or cut up fine and
fry in butter. If this meal is not sufficiently satisfying serve
some grated cold Swiss cheese in addition or drink fresh milk
with it. In place of the latter walnuts may be eaten at the
end of the meal. If the macaroni is served with tomato instead
of pea sauce, some form of the above mentioned protein
foods is absolutely necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MACARONI WITH BAKED CHEESE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil sufficient macaroni in salted water to fill a baking
dish two-thirds full, pour over it some hot milk or tomato
juice and a cupful of grated cheese, add a piece of butter and
bake until brown. Serve with string beans, green leaf salad
or pea soup.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RICE WITH PEA OR LENTIL SAUCE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook some rice in salted water. When done add a piece
of butter. Serve with the above mentioned sauce. Eat nuts
at the end of the meal, either alone or in combination with
dried currants or raisins.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SPANISH OMELET.</h4>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of the cooking omelet put a roll of hot
spinach, turn over carefully and serve on a platter with puree
of tomato as a gravy.</p>

<p class='c012'>A pinch of pepper on gravies, milk soups, or other nutritious dishes,
if mixed thoroughly with the food, assists in the coagulation of soft
nitrogenous foods and prevents putrefaction, but excess of it, or if
sprinkled on dry food, is very harmful. Free salt and ground spices
create an abnormal desire for water and food, and they injure the
mucous membrane lining of the blood vessels and glandular structures,
and obstruct the capillaries.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEAS AND CHESTNUTS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil blanched chestnuts until tender, then add some young
peas (canned or fresh ones boiled separately), let come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>a boil, season and serve with unleavened crackers or toast.
For dessert use grapes, oranges or fruit gelatine.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEA CHEESE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Bake or steam six medium sized potatoes. Then grate or
mash fine, add salt, pepper and some butter or one-half cup of
hot cream and one cup of pea puree. Mix well and pour into
a square dish. When cold, slice and dip into cracker crumbs
and brown in the oven or fry. Serve with carrots or mushrooms
and green salad. Chestnuts or walnuts are also a good
addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEA LOAF.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as the foregoing, pour into a baking dish and cover
with grated Swiss cheese. Bake in the oven and serve with
tomatoes or apple salad and green leaves. Beans and lentils
may be prepared in the same manner and flavored in different
ways. Parsnips may be used for bulk instead of potatoes.
The latter two vegetables are preferable to bread or toast
as bulk for the reason that it makes the dish too rich in certain
food elements.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c009'>SOUPS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>BEAN SOUP.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wash one and one-half cups of black, white, red or mixed
beans and soak in 1 quart of warm soft water over night.
The next day add 5 pints of cold or boiling water, let come
to a boil; add 2 finely cut onions and a potato, parsley or
other flavoring. Let simmer slowly for 3 hours or longer;
then strain. Heat some oil or butter, mix with 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls
of flour in a clean saucepan over the fire, add the
strained bean soup gradually, let boil a few minutes and
serve. A cupful of strained tomato juice and chopped parsley
may be added. Serve with fried bread or bread and butter
and raw carrots.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAM OF BEAN SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing. Leave out the fat, flour and
tomatoes; mix with one-fifth part or less of hot cream before
serving. Add plenty of chopped parsley.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LENTIL OR PEA SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like bean soup. Flavor with celery roots if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>VEGETABLE SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use Carque’s dried vegetables and follow directions on
the package. Add butter and flour or thicken with barley, rye,
or flaked wheat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soups. Many American housekeepers do not know how to prepare
soups and do not like them. The fact that people of many nations in
the world, with smaller incomes than the average American working man,
use soups daily, once or twice, and are far superior in physical strength
and endurance to the latter, should convince every one that nutritious
soups are an important article of diet.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>KNORR’S VEGETARIAN SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Knorr’s dried legumes and vegetable soups can be bought
in first class grocery stores. Some are prepared with meat,
others without. Legumes soups can be prepared in many
different ways. Sample: Cut up a few onions and potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and cook in the desired quantity of water. When partly done,
dissolve some dried legume powder, use less than the directions
call for. Let all cook 20 minutes. Mash up fine and run
through a colander. Add plenty of chopped parsley and a
little cream or thicken with butter and flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SPLIT PEA SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak one-third of a cup of green or yellow split peas in
soft water. Put to cook with two or three cups of water and
let simmer slowly for an hour or longer, add salt and flavoring
to suit the taste. When done, mash the peas fine with potato masher.
Dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of cornstarch in cold water
and add while stirring it. Let boil 5 to 10 minutes, remove
from the fire and add a teaspoonful of butter or two ounces
of hot cream and some chopped parsley. Serve with soda
crackers or zwieback. Raw celery, carrots, parsnips or
cucumbers may be substituted for the bread or eaten in
addition at the end of the meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ASPARAGUS SOUP. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut off one-third of the upper end of the asparagus, then
wash, cut in pieces and put to boil in water, add some salt;
when tender thicken the water with mixed flour, let boil 10
minutes. Add one-half hot milk. Flavor with pepper. Serve.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ASPARAGUS SOUP. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as No. 1; when tender heat some butter, thicken
with mixed flour, add the asparagus water gradually and boil
a few minutes. Then remove from the fire, stir several yolks
of eggs with a little cold water on a soup plate, add the
asparagus soup gradually. Flavor with lemon and serve.</p>

<p class='c012'>Close study and persistent effort will enable every homekeeper with
small means to learn how to prepare a soup that is palatable and
nutritious.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ASPARAGUS SOUP. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like No. 1; add three tablespoonfuls of fresh rich
cream or 3 yolks of eggs dissolved with a little cold water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Add lemon juice and a tablespoonful of butter before serving
if eggs are used. Hygienic crackers or black crusts are a good
addition. Serve as a whole meal mornings or evenings or as
an entree for dinner.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CORN SOUP. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dilute a can of corn with two canfuls of barley water and
press through a colander. Heat some butter, mix with flour
and add the hot broth. This is more suitable for breakfast
or dinner than for supper. Serve with black toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CORN SOUP. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dilute the corn with hot milk or water. Thicken with
corn starch, add a little hot cream or piece of butter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUTTERMILK SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix some white flour with cold buttermilk, stir over the
fire until it boils, add sugar and boil ten minutes. Add hot
cream or yolks of eggs or flavoring before serving, as desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH MACARONI.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Break some macaroni into boiling water, boil fast for 45
minutes. When done, add an equal part of buttermilk or
sweet milk. Thicken with a little rice flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH FLOUR DUMPLINGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare some flour dumplings with or without eggs. Drop
into boiling salted water; when done, add some hot milk or
buttermilk. Thicken with a little flour, add salt and serve.
Sweet dried fruits can be added.</p>

<p class='c012'>Left-over skim-milk is best utilized for cheese, pancakes, whey gruel,
whey or milk sauce, or boiled and served with stale rye or corn bread.
Vegetables prepared with milk do not make a good combination. Soft
puddings prepared with skim-milk, sugar and eggs, are not very wholesome
unless the necessary amount of fat is added in the form of butter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Skim-milk and fruit is not a good combination.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUTTERMILK SOUP WITH RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook some rice with water as directed for “Water Rice”;
when done add one quart of buttermilk to one quart of cooked
rice, mix well and stir over the fire until it boils. Add one-third
cup of sugar and simmer with a piece of cinnamon or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>vanilla for half an hour longer. Add more salt if necessary.
Some dried soaked cold prunes, currants or raisins may be
mixed with the soup before serving. This forms a perfect
meal for dinner on hot summer days or for supper in winter
or summer.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH EGG.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, arrowroot or fine
white flour with a cupful of cold water; add a little salt and
the yolks of two eggs and beat with an egg beater. Then
mix one quart of fresh milk with a cup of water and heat over
a quick fire to about 170° F. Then add the flour and egg,
some lemon rind, vanilla bean or bitter almond. Stir fast or
beat with an egg beater over the fire until it comes to a boil.
During hot weather this soup can be served cold, as a light
luncheon or for supper. For this purpose it should be stirred
for a while after removing it from the fire until it is nearly
cold. Serve with crackers, toast or strawberries. If a sweet
flavor is desired, add a tablespoonful of sugar, honey or
Eagle brand Condensed Milk with the other flavoring. If
skim milk is used add a tablespoonful of butter also.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH BARLEY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and soak a cup of pearl barley with soft water for
several hours or over night. Put on to cook with a quart of
water and a little salt. Let simmer slowly for about one hour;
then add a quart of cold or hot milk. Stir well and let cook
10 to 20 minutes longer. Serve with toast or with bread and
butter for a lunch or supper or as an entree.</p>

<p class='c012'>People who are not able to digest a sufficient amount of protein or
cereals, require more fats. The latter can be made easily digestible if
rightly combined and prepared in the form of soups, warm sauces, boiled
custards and mayonnaise dressing. In this way the fat globules are
equally divided in the food and can be better emulsified.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash four tablespoonfuls of rice, boil in 1½ pints of water
with a little salt until the grains burst. Then add 1½ pints
of hot or cold milk and cook 10 minutes longer. Flavor to
suit the taste. Serve with soda crackers or with toast. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>skim milk is used add butter after removing the soup from
the fire or cook the butter with the grains before the milk
is added.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH OATS OR BUCKWHEAT.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash one-half cup of either with cold water several times.
Put on to boil with a quart of water and salt to taste. Let
cook for about 40 minutes or until the grains burst. (Buckwheat
requires nearly an hour to cook). Then add 2 cups of
rich milk and let come to a boil. Serve plain or with dried
soaked fruit. Bread is not needed at this meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH CORN MEAL OR RICE FLOUR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Bring three cups of milk and 1½ of water to a boil. Dissolve
4 to 6 tablespoonfuls of meal with half a cup of cold
water and stir into the hot milk. Add salt and cook it for
20 minutes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH CORN STARCH.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as the foregoing. Cook 10 minutes. Dried currants
are a good addition. Corn meal being rich in oil and
pure in nitrogen, combines better with skim milk than some
of the other cereals.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH WHEY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a pint of sweet whey according to directions; then
heat to the boiling point and add a cup of hot water. Heat
some butter or vegetable oil, mix with two tablespoonfuls of
mixed flour, add the hot whey gradually and salt to taste. Let
cook a few minutes, then add one cup of hot milk. Flavor.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH CHOCOLATE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Bring 3 cups of milk and 1 of water to a boil, add a piece of
vanilla bean. Dissolve chocolate and pour into the boiling
milk. Let cook a minute; then dissolve 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls
of corn starch or arrowroot with a little cold water and stir
into the hot chocolate. Add salt and serve. Black crusts or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>toast are a good addition. Potato-flour can be used instead of
arrowroot. It is cheaper, and can be bought at a first class
store.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this soup is prepared from cocoa, add the necessary
amount of sugar and prepare the same as the foregoing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH BROWN FLOUR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Brown some flour according to directions. Dissolve with
warm water and stir into boiling milk or half milk and half
water. Let boil a few minutes. Flavor.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK SOUP WITH WHITE FLOUR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as above. Use plain or mixed flour. Add the yolk
of an egg and a piece of butter, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Water Soups and Gruels.</h4>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER SOUP. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Melt a tablespoonful of butter or oil, mix with 1 tablespoonful
of white or mixed flour over the fire. Then add
gradually a pint or less of boiling salted water while stirring.
Boil a few minutes. Serve.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER SOUP. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as above. Add a grated carrot or half of an apple
and boil for about 10 minutes. Add 2 to 3 ounces of rich hot
milk before serving.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER SOUP. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut up an onion or any desired vegetable and soak for half
an hour. Strain and prepare as No. 1. Add 2 tablespoonfuls
of cream, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER SOUP. No. 4.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as No. 1. After removing from the fire add two
tablespoonfuls of hot cream or dilute the yolk of an egg or
one-half tablespoonful of almond butter with an ounce of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>cold water. To this add the hot soup gradually. Two ounces
of cold buttermilk may be used instead of cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER SOUP. No. 5.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as No. 1. Add an ounce of fresh or preserved
fruit juice or a tablespoonful of fruit jelly before serving.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BARLEY SOUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and soak a cup of pearl barley. Boil with 2 to 3

<h4 class='c016'>STEEL CUT OATS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as buckwheat groats. Rolled oats may
be used instead.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ROLLED OATS WITH CRANBERRY SAUCE.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Cereals are the most perfect products of the vegetable kingdom, and
make fairly well balanced foods. They are deficient in fat, with the
exception of corn and oats.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ROLLED WHEAT.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare and serve like rolled oats. Cranberries, prunes,
apricots, or apple sauce, are all good additions. The yolk of

dried prunes and serve with or without cream. The dried
fruit should be soaked for a short time in a small amount of
water. A teaspoonful of nut cream may be substituted for
two ounces of cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RAW ROLLED WHEAT OR RYLAX.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak each separately as in the foregoing or take equal
parts of each. Dried soaked currants are an excellent addition
to wheat and rye where the very sweet fruits are not desirable.
Cream is a more necessary addition to wheat and rye than
to oats.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BRAN MUSH.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Bring one and one-half to two cups of water to a boil, add
one-half teaspoonful salt. Drop in one shredded wheat biscuit

cup of warm water over night. Keep the water warm, if possible.
A small amount of salt may be added. Serve with
cream and dates, or with bananas, carrots, or nuts.</p>

<p class='c012'>Oats are rich in fat and lime, and like wheat and rye belong to the
most perfect foods. A fireless cooker is a convenient apparatus for the
preparation of oats and wheat. They should be thoroughly cooked for
at least half an hour before setting them into the fireless cooker.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>BOILED WHOLE WHEAT.</h4>

<h4 class='c016'>BARLEY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak a cup of pearl barley over night in soft water, and the
next day boil it in 5 or 6 cups of water for two hours or
longer. Flavor with onion, if desired, and if it does not become
thick enough, dissolve a little rice flour with cold water, and
add it to the barley ten minutes before removing from the fire.
Serve with cream or with lettuce for breakfast or dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rye is richer in minerals and contains less starch than wheat. It
is not superior to wheat, but it is one of the oldest and most perfect
foods, and is the staff of life to some of the healthiest and strongest
races of the old world. It is laxative, and because of this it is more
suitable for certain individuals than for others.</p>

or 30 minutes. Remove from the fire and add a piece of
butter and the yolk of an egg, or serve the rice with hot cream.
Dried currants, raisins, apricots or prunes may be mixed with
the rice. If eaten in place of mush, pour the rice on soup
plates, and add hot cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Allow a pint of water and a pint of fresh milk to come to a
boil with vanilla or cinnamon, and put into it three or four
tablespoonfuls of Japan or Carolina rice, which has been
soaked for several hours. Boil rapidly until the starch granules
burst, then boil slowly for 40 minutes longer. If it is not
thick enough, mix a little cornstarch in cold water, and add to
the rice when nearly done. The yolk of one or more eggs
may be added before serving, if desired. It may be eaten plain
in the form of a thick gruel or with a fruit sauce. It will serve
as a whole meal for children, morning, noon, or evening. A
few nuts, or some celery, may be eaten at the end of the meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Baked and boiled cereals are more nutritious than bread. In the
fermenting process which takes place in rising bread, valuable substances
such as lime and salts are lost. It is rendered more acid, and therefore
unfit for food for people with weak stomachs. If yeast bread is combined
with foods which render the fluids of the stomach alkaline, it is less
harmful.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIGHT RICE WITH EGG.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash two tablespoonfuls of rice, boil rapidly in one pint of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>water with a little salt until the grains burst. Then boil slowly
in the oven or on the stove (uncovered) until the rice is dry.
Remove from the fire and add one teaspoonful of butter, the
yolk of one egg and a few drops of lemon juice. Serve plain
with two soda crackers or one small round zwieback.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RICE CREAM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook one cup of rice like plain, water rice with a stick of
cinnamon, or vanilla. When done, add the yolks of several
eggs and a piece of butter, or some hot cream and two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, or one-half cup of soaked currants or
raisins. Stir over the fire until it boils again. Serve hot or
cold with fruit sauce.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ALMOND RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cook rice with water as directed for boiling rice. When
done, remove from the fire, and mix with it some almond butter
stirred smooth with a little water. Some dried currants or
apricots previously soaked may be mixed with the rice. In
combination with a dish of lettuce it will serve as a whole
meal. A few whole almonds may be eaten at the end of this
meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil rapidly for 30 minutes one-half cupful of rice with 3
cupfuls of water and a little salt. Peel three medium sized
apples, cut them into small pieces after removing the cores, and
add to the rice with one tablespoonful of sugar. Cook on the
stove or in the oven until the apples are tender. Remove from
the fire, add a piece of butter, and serve with eggs or cheese.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rice, although low in protein and fat, is one of the most easily
digested of all cereals, and is especially suitable for brain workers and
people of sedentary habits.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CHERRY RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like apple rice, and use ripe black cherries, or
canned cherries. Omit the juice. A tablespoonful of sugar
may be added to the fruit while boiling. It is necessary to
have the rice boiled in sufficient water, and long enough to
allow each grain to burst before the fruit is added, or the acid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of the fruit will prevent the rice from softening. Butter alone,
or butter and the yolk of an egg, should be added when acid
or sub-acid fruits are mixed with cereals. Serve with sterilized
cream or with eggs, or eat nuts at the end of the meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CURRANT RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like cherry rice. Add fresh ripe or dried currants
in place of cherries. Serve with sterilized cream or with fried
or boiled eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RHUBARB RICE.</h4>

has been cooled. Serve with sterilized cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOMATO RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like apple rice. Use one-half to one cupful of
strained, canned tomato juice. Omit sugar. An onion may be
boiled with the rice, if desired. Serve with fried eggs and
greens.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BROWN RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Brown the rice in butter to a light yellow color. Add sufficient
boiling water and salt, and boil one-half hour or longer.
Dried mushrooms may be added, if desired. Serve with eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CARROT RICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put some rice to boil in water with salt. Cut young French
carrots into small pieces and add; both will be done about the
same time. Add finely chopped parsley and a piece of butter.
Serve with peas puree.</p>

<p class='c012'>People who have a tendency to high blood pressure and those who
suffer from intestinal indigestion should eat sparingly of macaroni and
other white flour preparations.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MACARONI WITH CREAM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Break up some macaroni and put in a saucepan, adding
boiling water and a little salt. Boil for 30 minutes, and add
more water if necessary. Dissolve some rice flour in a little
cold water and thicken the macaroni, then cover and bake in
an oven for 30 minutes or longer. Heat some rich cream in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>another saucepan and mix with the macaroni, and serve.
Flavor with a little pepper, or finely chopped parsley.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>NOODLES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat two eggs with two large tablespoonfuls of water and
a little salt. Mix with sufficient white flour to make a stiff
paste. Put some flour on a wooden board, knead the dough
and add more flour until hard and dry; then roll out as thin
as possible, dry in the sun or on a table, and cut into fine
strips. Boil in salted water for half an hour. Serve with
tomatoes, grated Swiss cheese and lettuce.</p>

swim on top. Serve with stewed prunes or apricots.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BREAD DUMPLINGS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the crust from one-third of a loaf of milk bread
and soak the soft part in cold water for 5 minutes. Put into
a clean cloth and force out the water. Cream three tablespoonfuls
of butter, or melt some fat, mix the bread and stir
it very smooth. Let it cool, and add the yolks of four eggs,
salt, a little mace, some finely chopped parsley, and onion, if
desired. Then beat the whites of two eggs, mix with the mass
and form dumplings with a dessert spoon. Put them into
the boiling soup and cook for about 5 minutes or until they
swim on top.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED CORN MEAL DUMPLINGS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil in two cups of milk or water two cups of white corn
meal with a tablespoonful of butter, stirring all the time,
until the mass is very thick. Let cool. Flavor with lemon
rind and nutmeg, and mix with three or four well beaten

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c009'>BREAD AND CAKES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>POMPERNICKEL OR BLACK BREAD.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prepare a sponge with a pint of white flour, three-fourths
of a yeast cake, a little salt and sugar, and a pint of warm
water. When light, add two quarts of rye meal, a tablespoonful
of salt and about one quart of water. Mix well, and let
rise over night. The next morning add about one quart of
warm rye meal, and one of white flour; knead the dough for
at least one-half hour. Let rise again, knead a little more,
and shape into loaves. When light, bake in a hot oven for
about an hour. Pure rye meal may be used in place of one-fourth
white flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as black bread. Use whole wheat flour
in place of rye meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Bread and cake may be kept sweet and free from mildew for a long
time in the following way: Cut it with a sharp knife, when about four
days old, into slices about one inch thick, then place it on a large wire
screen in the hot sunshine, cover with a cheese-cloth, and let it lie for
several hours, turning each slice until thoroughly dry. Then place the
slices in an upright position in a square box made of wire screening, and
keep in a dry or sunny place, covered with a light cloth. The box may
be placed in the sunshine several times a week.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIGHT WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Make a sponge from one cupful of lukewarm water and
one cake of yeast, with enough white flour to make the thickness
of sponge cake. Cover and set in a warm place, about 90
degrees F. When foamy, add about three pints of lukewarm
water, or milk which has been scalded and cooled to lukewarm,
about two teaspoonfuls of salt, a little sugar and a piece of
butter or fat. Stir into it with a spoon sufficient white flour
to make it of the same consistency as the first sponge. Beat it
from 10 to 15 minutes, dust the top with flour, and put it into
a warm place to rise. When light, add enough whole wheat
flour to make a stiff dough. Put it on bread-board with flour
to prevent sticking, knead for half an hour or longer, and let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>it rise again. When light, shape in loaves without kneading,
put into pans and prick top with a fork several times. When
sufficiently raised, bake in hot oven for about an hour. Cover
top with pieces of oiled paper, the first 20 or 30 minutes. When
done, put the bread on a sieve or in towels to cool.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LIGHT GRAHAM BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare in the same manner as light whole wheat bread.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHITE BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as whole wheat bread, using pure, rich
milk, cream and water, or sweet whey. Add a large piece of
butter or konut. Use white flour instead of whole wheat,
mix it with one-fourth white corn meal, or rice flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COFFEE CAKE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as white bread, using less flour, and add
a few well beaten eggs, the grated rind of several lemons and
oranges, or flavor with nutmeg, dried fruit, vanilla, mace or
bitter almonds. Serve with fresh, sweet milk, or with scalded
milk, as a whole meal for supper.</p>

<p class='c008'>All breads and cakes made with yeast are more nutritious
and wholesome when stale, on account of the evaporation of
water and the changes which take place in the bread. They
should be kept in tins with holes on all sides, to allow a perfect
circulation of air. The tins should be placed in the sunlight,
or on a high, dry place near a stove. In many foreign countries
pompernickle is kept for many months during the winter by
placing it on top of high stone ovens near the ceiling. It
finally assumes a sweet taste similar to that of nuts.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RAW BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Grind your wheat, rye or corn in an old-fashioned stone
burr mill, and partake of it at each meal instead of bread. This
is less expensive than the so-called “unfired bread”. Not
more than one to three tablespoonfuls should be consumed at
each meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Plain cake, coffee cake, fruit tarts and fruit pies are more wholesome
than cakes that are prepared with large amounts of sugar or frosting.
Whipped cream and fruits are good additions to cake, if agreeable. Light
desserts in the form of cake or pudding are more wholesome if eaten at
the beginning of a meal or else be served after soup or salad.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>TOASTS.</h4>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'>WATER TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use zwieback, or toast some stale white bread over the
open fire. Lay on a plate and pour over it quickly boiling
water, slightly salted, and drain off at once. Serve plain, or
spread with sweet butter, or the yolk of an egg.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOMATO TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like the foregoing, spreading with tomato puree in
place of butter. Drink with it rich fresh milk. This is excellent
for some people who have difficulty in digesting milk.
Strained hot tomato juice may be used in place of water.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BARLEY TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like tomato toast. Use thick, barley jelly prepared
from pearl barley, or soften the toast with barley water.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RICE TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use thick rice jelly prepared from Carolina rice. Flavor
with cinnamon, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RYE OR BRAN TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Make a strong tea from toasted black bread and bran, and
prepare like the foregoing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PRUNE TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soften some black or white toast with boiling water, and
add a little salt. Spread with thick prune juice. Sterilized
cream may be added.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APRICOT TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as prune toast. Add cream or a piece of
butter and the yolk of an egg.</p>

<p class='c012'>Predigested foods are beneficial for the sick, and under certain
conditions for the well, provided they are not over-indulged in. If
desired, they are generally best eaten at the evening meal, after the
body has expended considerable energy, and is too tired to properly digest
natural foods. If over-indulged in they keep the stomach from doing
its proper work, and tend to make it weak and lacy.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAM TOAST OF WHEAT BREAD OR SHREDDED WHEAT.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve one tablespoonful of milk sugar in one-half or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>three-fourths cup of boiling water and pour over one slice of
whole wheat bread or biscuit. Let stand a minute, then add
four ounces of hot cream, and serve.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CRANBERRY OR TOMATO TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Heat two small round or one long zwieback and soften with
two tablespoonfuls of tomato or cranberry sauce. Serve on
a plate and drink milk with it.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use thick apple sauce. Prepare the same as apricot toast.
The four last recipes are excellent for constipation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Scald some fresh milk. Add a stick of cinnamon, if desired.
Pour over white or black toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAM TOAST. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like water toast. Bring some fresh cream to a boil
with a stick of cinnamon. Add when the toast is soft. Use
black or white toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAM TOAST. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a white sauce from butter, salt, flour and hot water,
as directed in “Sauces.” Add one-fourth of a cup of hot cream
and pour over black toast, which has been softened with one-half
cup of hot water.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CREAM TOAST. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use sweet whey in place of hot water, and prepare as No. 2.
The cream may be omitted.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CELERY TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut some celery and cook until tender. Soften the toast
with the celery water. Prepare a plain butter sauce and add
cream, if desired. Mix with the celery and pour over the toast.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SPINACH TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut off the stems and select only fresh, tender leaves. Cook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and chop as fine as possible, flavoring with butter and lemon
juice. Soften some black or white toast with broth or spinach
water, and add the spinach. Serve with hard boiled eggs for
dinner. If it is desired for supper, and if the patient’s stomach
is delicate, use only the hard yolks. Fried beachnut bacon
may be added. If the flavor of onion is desired, remove the
onion before serving. This is good for constipation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EGG TOAST. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat one egg with three tablespoonfuls of water and a
little salt. Let the toast soften in it and fry to a golden brown
in one-half butter and half vegetable fat or oil.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EGG TOAST. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use cream or unsweetened condensed milk. Beat up with
eggs, salt and cinnamon, and prepare like the foregoing. This
is good for diabetic patients.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BISCUITS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix one quart of white flour with one-fourth of entire
wheat flour, corn meal, or rice flour. Mix it thoroughly with
two level teaspoonfuls of salt, and four of baking powder. Rub
into it two tablespoonfuls of vegetable fat or butter. Mix with
rich milk and prepare as usual. Serve with eggs, or with rich
cheese and olives and salad of greens.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>POP-OVERS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Grease the iron gem pans, and place on the stove or in the
oven, to have them very hot. Then beat two eggs very light,
mix a cup of rich milk with a cup of flour, and a half teaspoonful
of salt; add the eggs and beat with an egg beater until all
is very light. Pour the mixture into the pans, filling two-thirds
full, and bake in a quick oven. This will make about eight
pop-overs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BRAN MUFFINS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix one cupful of white flour with one-half cup of graham
flour and one and one-half cups of finely sifted bran. Rub into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>it three tablespoonfuls of butter; then add one and one-half
cups of sour milk, a teaspoonful of soda, a little salt and three
tablespoonfuls of molasses. Put into hot muffin tins, and bake
in a hot oven.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BRAN BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff snow, add a little
salt, and mix with two tablespoonfuls of fine, sifted bran, and
two of fine rye nuts. Put the mixture on a pie tin and bake in
a very moderate oven. Leave the door open. Serve with apple
salad and lettuce.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOSTON BROWN BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix together one cup of coarse corn meal, one of rye flour,
one of graham flour, and a teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve two
teaspoonfuls of soda in two cupfuls of sour milk and mix with
the flour, adding three-fourths cup of molasses. Pour into
narrow, oiled tins, and steam for four hours. Serve with lettuce,
celery and apple, or tomato salad, and nut butter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHITE MUFFINS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use mixed flour, or rice and wheat as suggested for white
bread. Mix with baking powder and salt. Use two eggs and
about one and one-half cups of rich milk to about three cups
of flour. Serve with tomato or peas puree and lettuce for
breakfast or supper.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PASTRY FOR TARTS OR PIES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix one and a half cups of white flour with one-half cup of
rice flour. Add one-half teaspoonful of salt, shorten the flour
with three tablespoonfuls of butter and three of oil. Then add
to it the yolks of two eggs beaten with sufficient ice cold water
and a little flavoring to make a paste which is not very stiff.
Roll it several times, then cover and put it in the ice box for
an hour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Avoid fresh breads, inferior cakes and pastry. Do not eat unless
you are hungry. Do not over-indulge in athletic or any other kind of
exercise. Remember that natural feeding, pure air and sufficient sleep
call for natural breathing and natural exercise. Unnatural feeding and
late hours create disease or nervousness.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SAND TART.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix one-half pound of white flour and one-half pound of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>rice powder, or wheat starch. Keep in a warm place. Melt
one pound of butter, cool and cream with one pound of sugar,
adding ten yolks of eggs, alternating with the flour. Stir the
mass for one-half hour, add the rind of two lemons, the juice of
one-half lemon, and 2 tablespoonfuls of flavoring extract. Beat
the whites of 10 eggs, mix lightly with the dough, and add a
teaspoonful of baking powder. Bake in a moderate oven for
one and one-half to two hours. During the first half hour
have more heat at the bottom than at the top. During the
last half hour have little or no heat at the bottom. The cake
tin should not be moved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tart may be baked in layers or on round tins and be
mixed with different colors, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PLAIN CAKE.</h4>

add two eggs, two cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder, a little salt, one cup of water, one-half cup of raisins or
currants, and any kind of flavoring. Bake in cake tins. Cake
prepared with water is more wholesome than with milk.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FROSTING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cream equal quantities of butter and chocolate. Spread on
the layers when cold. Frosting prepared from pure sugar is
unwholesome.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>NUT-BUTTER PIE CRUST.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Take one to two tablespoonfuls of nut-butter to one of
flour, add sufficient water to make a dough.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spread Granose cakes with diluted almond-butter and a
layer of strawberries over it. Serve with nuts or with milk
soup prepared with sago.</p>

<p class='c012'>Artificial sugar is not a necessary article of food for the healthy
individual who is able to supply his body with fresh and dried fruits
the year round. The delicious summer fruits are better eaten without
sugar. Undoubtedly nature did not mean for us to indulge in sweets
during hot days, or she would have provided us more plentifully with
them.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a light biscuit dough, bake in tins and cover with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>strawberries and whipped cream. Use no more sugar than is

to three-fourths cup of strong black coffee. Stir well and
bake in a moderate oven for one hour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MIXED FLOUR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix two cups of white flour with one cup of rice flour and
one of cornstarch. Sift and keep in a tin box for sauces and
soups.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RYE NUTS. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the outer crust from a loaf of stale pompernickel
and grate the soft part on a grater. Pour the crumbs on a
large piece of paper, and dry in the sun or in an oven. Keep in
a dry place, in a tin with good ventilation.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RYE NUTS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut a loaf of stale pompernickel into thin slices and remove
the crusts. Cut the inside into small strips, lengthwise and
crosswise. Allow it to dry thoroughly in a moderate oven or
in the sun, and while still warm, grind it through a coarse meat
grinder. Place it again in an oven or in the sun to dry, or
brown slightly. If desired as fine as grape nuts, grind it again
or sift it, and keep in a dry place. It may be mixed with one-half
grape nuts. Use as directed in menus and recipes. The
outside crusts may be dried in the oven or sun, and kept in
tins. The crusts are an excellent addition to milk soups or
other soft foods.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rye combines well with all starchy fruits and vegetables, which are
deficient in minerals, such as potatoes, pumpkins, squash, melons, turnips,
carrots, beets, bananas, cucumbers, rice and corn. It also combines well
with sweet fruits. Apples, pork, veal, lamb, cheese, eggs, cream, milk,
bacon and oily foods are all good additions to rye. Boiled rye and
starchy foods are unsuitable combinations.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Sauces are a necessary addition to cooked foods, especially
in cold weather. The proper utensils used for sauce making
are wooden spoons and flat, round-bottomed saucepans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Good fresh butter, oil and dry flour are necessary to make
nutritious sauces. Flour for thickening should boil at least
ten minutes. If the flour is to be cooked with fat before the
liquid is added, only a few minutes of boiling is necessary, for
the reason that fat, when boiled, reaches a higher temperature
than water or milk. Mixed flour is preferable to pure wheat
flour.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUTTER SAUCE. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter, or half butter and half

and the necessary amount of sugar. Dissolve three teaspoonfuls
of cornstarch with a little cold water and stir into the
lemon juice. Boil ten minutes. Remove from the fire and mix
with a tablespoonful of butter while warm. The lemon rind
can be grated and added to the sauce instead of boiling the
rind. This is good for steamed puddings. The yolk of an
egg may be added.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CHERRY SAUCE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as number one, add the desired amount of dried
mushrooms, which have been soaked in water for several
hours, and boil for ten minutes. Serve with rice.</p>

<p class='c012'>The best way to use spices is to buy them whole, in the fresh or
dried state, and chop, grate, or grind them when needed. Vanilla beans,
bitter almonds, bay leaves, cinnamon bark and many others may be used
whole and removed before serving.</p>

desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SALAD DRESSINGS FOR CEREALS, VEGETABLES AND FRUITS.</h4>

<p class='c012'>Great care should be exercised in the preparation of foods with
nut-butter. Never spread it on bread without first diluting it with an
equal amount of water. Do not keep it on the shelf like ordinary butter
after it has been mixed with water; prepare only sufficient to last for
twenty-four hours, and keep it on ice.</p>

<p class='c007'>They can be prepared from oil, butter, eggs, cream or nut
butter. Dressings prepared from nut butter are especially good
during the summer months. They can be prepared by making
a plain butter sauce with flour and water, and adding nut butter
before serving, or by diluting nut butter with water to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>desired consistency. They may be flavored with orange or
lemon juice. If a sweet flavor is desired, boil a little water
with sugar, then add the juice of lemon or oranges and mix

may be added sugar, pepper, salt, parsley or mustard, if desired.
The proportion of oil and vinegar may be changed according
to the taste. For fruit salads, lemon should always be
used instead of vinegar. For raw vegetables, the dressing
should not be poured over the salad until ready to serve.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>HONEY OR SYRUP DRESSING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Add the juice of one lemon, orange, or grapefruit, to one-half
cup of honey or table syrup. Mix well and serve with pancakes.
This is more nourishing and wholesome than pure
sweets. Do not prepare more than enough for one meal at
a time.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SYRUP DRESSING. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Let a half cup of syrup and a small tablespoonful of vinegar
come to a boil. Add one finely chopped onion. Remove from
the fire and cool, adding the desired amount of oil, and mixing
well. This is good for lettuce and watercress. Serve with
pancakes, or baked rolled oats. If lemons or oranges are used
in place of vinegar, do not allow the latter to boil. Prepare
fresh for each meal. Do not use vinegar or onions with
fancy fruits.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SALADS.</h4>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE SALAD. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel some tart apples, slice and mix with French or mayonnaise
dressing. Garnish with lettuce. Grapenuts or ryenuts
may be sprinkled over this. Serve with egg food or
nuts or any kind of cheese for lunch or dinner. For breakfast
or supper serve with black toast or hygienic crackers. If
protein foods are added, use the lightest form.</p>

<p class='c012'>Do not combine legumes with bananas, berries or other fancy summer
fruits.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>APPLE SALAD. No. 2.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Peel, slice and chop in chopping bowl as fine as rice. Then
prepare and combine as explained in number one. Onion is
a good addition. Chop or grate the onion very fine, mix with
a little oil and lemon juice separately. Add this to the apple
and the mayonnaise last of all.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE SALAD. No. 3.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Arrange some lettuce or celery in a salad bowl, add dried
raisins, currants or shredded cocoanut. Serve with nuts. Nut
cream may be added to the apples in place of the cocoanut. If
bread is desired “unleavened” is the best. Grapenuts or ryenuts
sprinkled over the salad makes it look dainty and
appetizing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CELERY SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Cut the tender white stalks into small pieces. Add chopped
apples and nuts or salad dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CUCUMBER SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel and slice the cucumbers thin and pour French or mayonnaise
dressing over them. They may be combined with
lettuce, tomatoes, chopped parsley or onions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOMATO SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare and mix like cucumber salad. Serve with French
or mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOILED VEGETABLE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use left-over asparagus, string beans, cow beans, lima
beans, peas or cauliflower. Pour over them French dressing
half an hour before serving, adding lettuce and mayonnaise
dressing when ready to serve.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cucumbers are a valuable food and should be eaten almost daily by
growing children and anemic people, especially if much muscular work
is required. If eaten in combination with half a dozen other articles,
it produces indigestion. Cucumbers should never be eaten at night.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use the innermost part of a head of cabbage. Cut and chop
very fine, add lemon and olive oil, and mix with mayonnaise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>dressing. A cold grated potato may be added for those who
have difficulty in digesting cabbage.</p>

French dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>YELLOW DOCK SALAD OR SOUR GRASS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and serve plain or mix with lemon and olive oil.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LETTUCE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Lettuce should be kept in a cool, dry place and not left in
water longer than 15 minutes. It may be served alone as a
salad mixed with French dressing or served in combination
with fruits, starchy foods or other vegetables, and eaten in
addition to cheese, eggs, nuts or legumes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SPINACH SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Take some fresh leaves of raw spinach or use cold boiled
spinach, and mix with French dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CHEESE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Chop up some tart apples, arrange lettuce in a salad bowl,
pour in the apples, and sprinkle over it grated Swiss cheese.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lettuce is the most desirable green on our tables and combines
well with almost any kind of food. Being rich in minerals and alkaloidal
extracts, it tends to render the digestive fluids alkaline and promotes
oxidation and nutrition. People with delicate stomachs should not
eat lettuce at the evening meal.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>NUT SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Chop or grind in a nut grinder some almonds or walnuts.
Arrange lettuce and chopped apples in a salad bowl, sprinkle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the nuts over it, and serve with celery and raisins. The

<p class='c011'>Arrange lettuce in a salad bowl. Cut up hard boiled eggs,
pour over them French or mayonnaise dressing. Capers or
olives may be added.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CEREAL SALAD. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Mix a cupful of raw rolled wheat, oats or rye with a cup of
finely grated or chopped carrots. Add a few drops of lemon
or orange juice, and a little olive oil. Lettuce, celery or
parsley may be mixed or eaten with it.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CEREAL SALAD. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and chop lettuce or celery, and apples. Mix with
French or mayonnaise dressing. Then add an equal amount
of rolled raw cereals and serve. Parsley or watercress may be
added. A syrup dressing or onions combine well with it.
Peaches and apricots may be used in place of apples and carrots.
Onions should not be used with peaches or apricots.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EMPIRE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Ingredients: Two raw apples, two cold boiled potatoes,
six hard boiled eggs, three boiled beets, three stalks of celery
or one boiled celery root, onions, parsley, and two tablespoonfuls
of mustard. Chop fine each of the ingredients separately.
Set apart three tablespoonfuls of chopped whites of eggs,
yolks of eggs, beets and parsley. Mix all the other ingredients
well and add mayonnaise dressing. Put the salad on a platter
or into a large glass dish; garnish with lettuce and olives and
make designs of green, red, white, and yellow with left-over
ingredients.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nuts are high in nutritive value, and are better evenly combined
with non-protein elements than flesh foods are. They are rich in fat
and form an ideal diet in combination with raw fruits and
greens. They are not sufficiently appreciated as a food, and
receive much unjust criticism as to their digestibility. All nuts are
wholesome. The right combination and proportion, and the time of
day when eaten, are of great importance. The kind of activity as well
as individual peculiarities have much to do with likes and dislikes or
requirements of certain foods.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>CORN SALAD.</h4>
</div>

the acid taste is not liked, mix it with French dressing or serve
plain with tomatoes and green leaves.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STRING BEAN SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use canned or left-over string beans. Mix with French or
mayonnaise dressing and add chopped parsley. Serve with

<p class='c011'>Cut off the tips of raw asparagus, arrange some lettuce or
watercress in a salad bowl, and mix with French or mayonnaise
dressing. Sliced tomatoes may be added. Boiled asparagus
may be prepared in the same way.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MUSHROOM SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Arrange some lettuce or watercress in a dish, select fresh
mushrooms, wash and mix with French dressing, and pour
over the green leaves.</p>

<p class='c012'>Green corn is rich in fat and protein, and can form a perfect meal
during the summer if combined with tomatoes. Do not cook the corn
if it is agreeable raw. Canned corn should be used with care for people
with intestinal weaknesses. If used for soups it should be strained and
diluted with an equal amount of hot water before thickening.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>CELERY ROOT SALAD.</h4>
</div>

mayonnaise dressing. Flavor with parsley. Serve with lettuce
and tomato puree or with string beans or green peas and bread.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>POTATO SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil or steam some potatoes with their jackets on. When
done, peel and slice them into a deep bowl while warm; then
sprinkle over them a little salt, pepper, and finely chopped or
grated onion, and pour over them some boiling hot vinegar
diluted with one-half water and mixed with melted butter or
oil. Cover with a saucer and shake well; let stand for twenty
or thirty minutes. If there is too much liquid, pour off some

<p class='c011'>Mix equal parts of sliced apples and pineapples. Serve like
the foregoing or with nuts.</p>

<p class='c012'>Celery contains valuable minerals and is soothing to the nervous
system. Celery roots are rich in fat and a healing food for people
with kidney, liver, and intestinal trouble.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>PINEAPPLE AND ORANGE SALAD.</h4>

lemon and olive oil.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEACH SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Slice some bananas and mix with an equal quantity of green
grapes. Garnish with lettuce, and add lemon and olive oil,
if desired.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>RADISH SALAD. No. 2.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mix some chopped or sliced radishes with French or mayonnaise
dressing, and add lettuce or celery. Serve for breakfast
with whole wheat bread and butter, or with raw wheat

<p class='c011'>Grind, chop or slice the carrots and mix with French dressing.
Add chopped parsley, lettuce or celery. Serve with rye
or wheat flakes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PLUM SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Green, red and blue plums are all valuable fruits. The blue
plum is rich in iron, minerals, and sugar, and is, next to apples
and tomatoes, one of the most perfect fruits. It has great preserving
qualities and if picked on a dry, sunny day and placed
carefully in straw in a dry, cool place, will keep until Christmas.
Remove the stone and slice, mix with rylax or ryenuts or serve
with stale bread and butter. Nuts, lettuce and celery make a
good addition. Olive oil is also good.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DRIED VEGETABLE SALAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak Carque’s dried vegetables in a little water for several
hours. Then steam in a colander for about ten minutes. When
cold, add salad dressing or nut cream.</p>

<p class='c012'>Salads consisting of mixed nuts or mixed boiled vegetables are not
wholesome for delicate people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fresh raw fruits, if eaten in the right proportion with other articles,
are wholesome. The habit of eating a large amount of acid fruits at
the beginning of the morning meal is not necessary. If a heavy meal
is eaten in the evening, remaining half digested in the stomach over
night, and putrefying, then acid fruits will cleanse the stomach in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Apples are among the most perfect of fruits. People who have
difficulty in digesting a sufficient amount of cereals should eat apples
almost daily. If raw apples disagree, they can be made agreeable by
combining them with oil in the form of a salad. Baked apples and
apple sauce are also good, provided they are not spoiled with too much
sugar.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c009'>FRUITS AND LIGHT PUDDINGS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>STERILIZED DRIED FRUITS</p>

<p class='c008'>Place some dried cherries, apricots, currants or prunes in
a Mason jar. Fill to the top, cover with water, and let stand
over night. The next day set the jar into a water bath, heat
to the boiling point, then cool. Enough can be prepared to
last for several days. The juice may be used again for soaking,
or it can be used for fruit gruels.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SOAKED FRUIT. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash some dried fruit, put into a bowl, pour over some
hot or cold water, place over it a little saucer with a weight
upon it; in this way it requires less water; let stand over
night. It is ready for use the next morning, and may be mixed
with boiled cereals in place of sugar.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SOAKED FRUIT. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Place some dried fruit in a bowl, pour over it some hot
cereal coffee. Use in the same way as number one. This is
excellent for people suffering with fermentation of the
stomach. The cereal coffee acts as a preservative.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FIG BUTTER. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash some dried figs, dry them; then cut into small
pieces, and grind on a nut grinder. Mix with one-fourth (in
quantity) of ryenuts. Serve with whipped or sterilized cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FIG BUTTER. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as the foregoing. Mix with about one-third or
one-fourth of ground nuts, also with ryenuts, if desired. Serve
with lettuce.</p>

<p class='c012'>Compotes or Stewed Fruits are more wholesome and economical than
jams and jellies, which are prepared with large amounts of sugar. A
few jars of sterilized fruit juice should be prepared and kept on hand
for medicinal purposes only.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>RAISIN OR CURRANT BUTTER.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like figs. Mix with ground nuts. Serve with lettuce
or with chopped apples.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUCKTHORN BARK EMULSION. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Pour a quart of boiling water on five ounces of Buckthorn
bark, let steep for from 10 to 15 minutes, then strain; wash
about a half a pound of dried French prunes, cut into small
pieces, soak these with the strained hot Buckthorn tea for an
hour or longer, then steep until tender, press through a
colander thoroughly.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUCKTHORN BARK EMULSION. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Combine with fat, as follows: Heat a large tablespoonful
of olive oil or butter, mix with a tablespoonful of mixed flour,
gradually add to it the hot pulp of the prunes while stirring,
let boil three to five minutes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GROUND DATES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the stones and prepare as above. Mix with ryenuts
or orange juice. Serve with lettuce and sliced bananas

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED APPLES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and remove the core; then place in a baking tin,
stem end down; pour over some water and a little sugar, if
desired; bake in a moderate oven until tender. Let cool and
serve plain with butter and bread or with whipped or sterilized
cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED PEACHES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as baked apples, and serve with cream.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hot house fruits out of season are health destroying. Certain
fruits, such as apples, plums, tomatoes, apricots, grapes, figs, bananas and
cranberries, will keep for a long time in the natural state, if properly
preserved. Fresh fancy summer fruits are not required during the
winter by healthy individuals, neither are canned fruits, jams or jellies.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>AMBROSIA.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mash baked apples very fine and rub through a colander.

<h4 class='c016'>BAKED APPLES IN GELATINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare in the usual way, pour some fruit or rye gelatine
over them.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE SAUCE. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash some tart apples, cut into four pieces and remove the
seeds; steep with a little water and sugar until tender. Then
mash fine with a potato masher and run through a colander.
Add a piece of butter while warm. Apple sauce prepared in
this way is more wholesome than prepared from apples that
have been peeled.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE SAUCE. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak some dried apples over night, steep for 30 to 40 minutes

with a potato masher. Add a piece of butter. Let cool and
serve with eggs, or cheese.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BANANA GELATINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare some gelatine with orange, cranberry or lemon
juice. When nearly cold, cut up some bananas and mix with
the gelatine. Flavor and set on ice, serve with whipped or
sterilized cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PINEAPPLE GELATINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare some gelatine with lemon or orange juice. When
nearly cold, add some fresh or canned pineapple. Serve with
whipped or sterilized cream, and zwieback.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dried sweet fruits are more wholesome than canned summer fruits.
However, they should not be indulged in during hot summer days, or
in the spring time when the brain needs relaxation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>APPLE SNOW.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Prepare some apple sauce from dried or fresh apples, run

a colander and add a piece of fresh butter while warm. Serve
with French toast, corn bread, corn cakes, steamed puddings
or omelet.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GOOSEBERRY COMPOT.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the stems, wash the berries and pour some boiling
water on them. Let stand five minutes; then pour off the
water and add fresh boiling water, a stick of cinnamon and
the necessary amount of sugar. Thicken with cornstarch.
Serve with unleavened pancakes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the gooseberries in the same manner as for compot,
but use more water. When done, strain and thicken with
cornstarch. Let boil 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot or cold with
cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEWED BLACKBERRIES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash a pint of blackberries, put on to cook with two
pints of boiling water and a stick of cinnamon. Let simmer
slowly and add a few tablespoonfuls of sugar. When nearly
done thicken with a little cornstarch. Cool and serve with
milk rice, custard or pancakes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STEWED HUCKLEBERRIES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as stewed blackberries. Strain, if desired.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fruits are an important article of diet, but few people know how
to use them wisely. A large percentage of deaths in young children
is due directly to the wrong use of fruits.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>BAKED APPLES IN OIL.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wash some tart apples, wipe and core them. Have some
vegetable oil, boiling hot, drop in the apples and cook until
tender. Let cool and reheat when needed.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STRAWBERRIES WITH WHIPPED CREAM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Select fresh ripe berries and wash. Put the desired amount
on flat medium sized plates. Beat up some cream with the
whites of several eggs and a little powdered sugar. Cover
the berries with the cream and serve with wafers or triscuit.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEACHES AND PEARS WITH WHIPPED CREAM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Peel and slice them. Prepare and serve the same as the
foregoing. These dishes are not good for delicate stomachs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRUIT TAPIOCA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak a cupful of plain tapioca in a pint of cold water over
night, or for several hours. Cook in one pint of unfermented
apple, grape or berry juice in a double boiler, add salt and
sugar while boiling. Serve with sterilized cream. The
tapioca may be cooked in water, adding salt and sugar, when
cold add lemon juice and sliced pineapples, serve with whipped
cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BLACKBERRY SAGO.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil one quart of blackberries with about two quarts of
water and some sugar very slowly, then strain and cool, bring

sago. The latter must be well soaked. Serve warm with
zwieback or wafers and sweet butter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE SAGO.</h4>

tender strain and cool. Reheat, flavor with cinnamon and
sugar. Prepare with instantaneous tapioca or plain sago. After

  <h4 class='c016'>BERRY TAPIOCA.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Cook one quart of raspberries or blackberries with two
quarts of water, a piece of cinnamon, add three-fourths to one
cup of sugar, let boil slowly, then strain and cool. Reheat and
prepare with instantaneous tapioca. Pour on a soup plate,
pour sterilized cream over it. In cold weather, the cream as
well as the tapioca should be served warm.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RHUBARB PUDDING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash the stalks and cut off the green end. Cut the remainder
in small pieces and steep in earthenware with a stick
of cinnamon. When tender, strain and add the necessary
amount of sugar. Dissolve some cornstarch, arrowroot or
agar agar with cold water and stir into the fruit juice. Let
boil 10 minutes and serve warm on soup plates with sterilized
cream or put into molds and cool. If it is eaten warm, it is
preferable to let the fruit juice cool first, then reheat and
add the thickening.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>APPLE PUDDING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Save all the peeling from several days; add a few whole
apples. Cook with water, strain and prepare like rhubarb
pudding.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CURRANT, RASPBERRY OR PEACH PUDDING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as the foregoing. If peaches or peach
skins are used, do not press much of the pulp through. It is
better to use more peeling than whole fruits. In serving peach
or apple salad, the peelings can be saved from a day or two and
preserved by stewing them in a little water until ready for use.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LEMON FILLING FOR PIE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Stir the yolks of three eggs with one-half cup of sugar, add
the grated rind and juice of two lemons or one lemon and one
orange, then add two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, one of
butter and one and one-half cup of hot water. Stir in a
double boiler over the fire until it is thick. Then pour it into
the baked crust. Beat the whites with a tablespoon of sugar
and a little lemon juice. Put over the top and brown in the
oven.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>PLAIN JUNKET.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Warm one pint of milk to blood heat, flavor as desired;
stir in one junket tablet which has been dissolved in a little
water and pour into a dish; set on ice. Serve with cranberry
or prune sauce and wafers.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CRANBERRY SAUCE, STERILIZED.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put one cup of cranberries into a pint jar, add two and
one-half tablespoonfuls of sugar and sufficient water to fill the
jar; screw tight and cook in a water bath for 40 minutes or
longer. Let cool and run through a colander.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RHUBARB WINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash, and cut the red end of the plant into half inch
pieces. Put into a Mason jar, fill with water, screw tight and
set on a grate in a water bath. Cook 40 to 50 minutes. Raisin
wine or any kind of berry juice may be prepared in the same
manner. Sugar is not necessary. Stewed fruit prepared in
this manner is more wholesome and requires less sugar than
if cooked in the ordinary way. For fruit juice take one cup
of fruit to one and a half or two of water.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c009'>FLUIDS AND GELATINE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Fluids for Infants and Invalids.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>In preparing modified milk or other fluid foods for infants,
where top milk is used, it is very important that the milk
contain the same amount of cream for each feeding, or else
digestive disturbance and irregularity of bowel movements
will occur.</p>

<p class='c008'>If milk, fresh from the cow and run through the cooler, is
put into bottles or jars and kept at the same temperature, the
same percentage of top-milk will be obtained daily. Five hours
is generally sufficient to obtain the desired quality. The
best means of removing it is by a spoon or siphon.</p>

<p class='c008'>If raw milk is used without being sterilized, the desired
amount for each meal should be put into sterile bottles directly
after delivery and lightly covered by cheese-cloth or
cotton and kept on ice or other cool place. In this way each
bottle will contain the same amount of cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PREPARATION OF MODIFIED MILK (RAW).</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the desired amount of top-milk into as many bottles as
are required for feeding during twelve hours. Prepare a
solution of water and milk-sugar by dissolving the sugar with
the desired amount of boiling water. Let cool and keep on
ice for twenty-four hours. At each feeding, add the prescribed
amount of water to the milk, shake and heat in a water bath.
Add a tablespoonful of lime water or barley water. If the
milk cannot be obtained fresh twice per day, it is safer to scald
the milk which is used during the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Milk is a food, not a drink; it should never be taken in addition to,
or at the end of a heavy meal. Many people object to boiled milk on
account of a theory that it tends to constipate. Do not dwell on theories;
find out for yourself. Potatoes, toast and many other cooked foods are
constipating also. Why not object to those?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>All milk, even if handled carefully, contains a large number
of germs. When one is not certain that the cows from which
the milk is obtained are healthy, the milk should be sterilized.
During the summer it is safer to scald or sterilize all milk
for infants.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCALDED MILK (MODIFIED).</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve the desired amount of milk sugar in boiling water
in a clean saucepan, add the milk, stir over a quick fire until
it foams, which means that the milk is heated to about 200°F.
The most harmful germs are generally destroyed by this process.
Pour the milk into a clean pitcher and set the latter in a
pan of cold water. Stir the milk until cold and change the
water several times. The stirring makes the milk homogeneous
and easier to digest. If any scum has formed on top,
through careless preparation, the milk should be strained
through a cheese-cloth before putting it into bottles. Put a
cotton stopper in the bottles and set on ice. Milk prepared
in this manner is generally suitable for the average healthy
infant.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOILED MILK AND CREAM FOR TABLE USE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the desired amount of milk or cream, or mixed milk
and cream, into a clean saucepan, stir over a hot fire until it
reaches the boiling point or to about 200°F. Then pour into
a pitcher and set in a pan of cold water; stir until the milk is
cold. Set on ice or in a cold place for 24 hours. Milk prepared
in this way is the only wholesome kind to use in addition to
boiled cereals and fruit puddings. It is also often preferable
to raw cream and milk, in combination with raw fruits. If the
milk is to be used on cereals for the morning meal, it can be
reheated or used directly after boiling. If hot milk is added
to cereals, the sugar will not be missed.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>STERILIZED MILK (MODIFIED).</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve the milk sugar as directed for scalding milk. Add
the desired amount of milk, top-milk or cream, and prepare as
directed in the chapter under “Sterilized Milk.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PASTEURIZED MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the desired amount of milk or milk and cream mixture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>into sterile bottles, put on a stopper and set in a water bath;
heat the water to 155° or 170° F., and keep it at that temperature
for 30 minutes. Then remove the bottles at once, cool
them in a pan of cold water and set on ice.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOILED MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put the desired amount of milk, or modified milk into a
clean saucepan, stir over a hot fire and boil from two to five
minutes. Then cool by setting the pitcher into a pan of cold
water; stir until cold and set on ice. This is excellent for
infants as well as for the sick who suffer with diarrhoea. The
milk may be modified with arrowroot, barley water or rice
flour gruel, which has been boiled with salt and water and a
stick of cinnamon. Milk-sugar should be boiled with the
gruels, two level tablespoonfuls to a pint of boiling water.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>KUMISS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve one-fourth of a cake of compressed yeast in a little
warm water. Take a quart of fresh blood-warm milk, add to
it a tablespoonful of sugar and the yeast. Put the mixture
into beer bottles with patent stoppers, filling them to the
neck. Place them for about twelve hours in a room suitable
for raising bread, at a temperature of about 70°, then put
the bottles on ice, up side down, until wanted.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RICE WATER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash one-half a cup of Carolina rice several times with
water, then soak or put on to boil at once with three pints of
water. Boil slowly for about an hour, strain, and sweeten, or
flavor as desired. Serve plain or with one-fifth part of
sterilized cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BARLEY WATER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare in the same manner as rice water.</p>

<p class='c012'>If milk or cream is delivered in bottles, remove the cover immediately
after delivery. If the air where it stands is dusty, protect the
milk with cotton or cheese-cloth. Treat boiled milk in the same
manner.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>EAGLE BRAND CONDENSED MILK.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It can be prepared in many different ways, and mixed with
barley water, and cream, or used for sweetening in the preparation
of gruels.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHIPPED SOUR MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat one quart of thick, sour milk with an egg beater for
ten minutes. Serve with zwieback. Three-fifths tablespoonful
of powdered sugar and a little cinnamon may be added,
if it is agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whipped sour cream may be prepared the same as sour
milk.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHIPPED SWEET CREAM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Whip one quart of sweet, thick cream with two-fifths of a
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, add a little vanilla, if desired.
Serve with fruit gelatines or ground white figs, stewed
prunes, baked apples or raw fruits, such as peaches, strawberries,
raspberries or bananas.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CLABBER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put some fresh or skimmed milk into large soup plates
or wide bowls and set in a room which has plenty of ventilation.
Do not cover tight. If the room is exposed to dust, put
long sticks over the dish and cover with cheese-cloth. When
the milk is thick, set a little while in warm water until some of
the whey separates. Pour off about half of the liquid, so
the milk has the consistency of mush. Then pour over it some
fresh rich milk or cream, and serve. People who have no
tendency to flatulent dyspepsia may sprinkle a tablespoonful
of sugar and one of dried grated pumpernickel over it in addition
to the cream. Strawberries, raspberries, dried sweet
fruits, nuts and zwieback are also a good addition. This will
form a perfect meal on a hot summer day.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOAST WATER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Toast a slice of stale wheat or black bread until thoroughly
brown. Break into small pieces and pour on it two or three
cups of boiling water. Cover tightly, and set aside for twenty
minutes or longer. Strain, and flavor to suit the taste. Serve
hot or cold.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>TOAST AND APPLE WATER.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Prepare like toast water, and add the peelings of one or two
apples before pouring on the boiling water.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LEMONADE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil a quart of water for several minutes with three to five
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and the rind of one lemon. Remove
from the fire, add the juice of two or three lemons or oranges,
strain and cool. Fresh clean cold water may be added to suit
the taste. This is excellent in fevers, where much fluid food is
required. It may be served hot or cold.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BRAN TEA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak over night a cupful of Ralston’s select bran in one
quart of soft warm or cold water. The next day strain it and
serve raw, or put it on to boil, simmer for one-half hour, then
strain. Serve hot or cold. The bran may be mixed with oats
or ryenuts when put to soak, and may be used raw or boiled.
Hot bran tea with cream is excellent as a substitute for tea.
It can be prepared without soaking.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MALTED MILK. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put two teaspoonfuls of malted milk into a cup, pour on
some boiling water and add a pinch of salt and one-fourth of a
cup of cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MALTED MILK. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare as the foregoing, omitting the cream. Serve plain,
or add a few drops of lemon juice.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>UNFERMENTED BEER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak a cup of bran and a slice of thoroughly toasted black
bread for several hours in a quart of water. Add a stick of
cinnamon, bring to a boil and let simmer slowly for 20 minutes
or longer. Strain and serve hot or cold.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CAMOMILE TEA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put a tablespoonful of tea into a teapot and pour on it
one-half pint of boiling water. Allow it to stand on a hot
platter or over steam for five minutes. Then strain and serve.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>

<p class='c011'>Soak one of Hansen’s rennet tablets in a little cold water.
Heat one quart of skim milk or fresh milk until it is lukewarm.
Crush the tablet and mix with the milk, and stand on
a warm place for five minutes or until it is thick. Then heat
over the fire until the whey separates. Strain and throw
away the curd.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHEY. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Heat some fresh milk until it is blood-warm. Add Fairchild’s
essence of pepsin, according to directions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BRAN GELATINE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the same as Bran Tea, use less water. Black or
white toast may be added to the bran. Flavor with salt or
sugar or add a teaspoonful of condensed milk after straining.
Let cool and serve plain or with cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>IRISH MOSS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash and let it soak for several hours, or over night. Boil
for 10 minutes, strain through cheese-cloth, and add one-half
or two-thirds of a cup of hot milk. Flavor as desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RAW GREEN PEA JUICE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash some fresh green peas in the pods and grind through
a meat grinder, allowing the liquid to drain into a bowl.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LEMON WHEY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Heat a pint of fresh milk to about 200° F., remove from the

<h4 class='c016'>WATER EGGNOG. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat the yolk of an egg with one-half or a whole cup of
water. Flavor with lemon juice.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LEMONADE WITH EGG.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Take some lemonade prepared from oranges and lemons
and add to it the yolk or the whole of an egg. The acid taste
must dominate the sweet taste.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MILK EGGNOG.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Beat up the whole or the yolk of an egg with a little water
and one or two tablespoonfuls of sugar. To this add eight
to ten ounces of rich raw or sterilized milk, or one-half cream
and one-half water. Flavor with nutmeg or bitter almond.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FRUIT LEMONADE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil some water with a little sugar and the rind of a
lemon, orange or apple. Add to it some preserved strawberry,
cherry, pineapple, currant or raspberry juice, and seltzer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>water, or add a mixture of several different fruit juices. This
is excellent for fever patients, but not for people suffering
with lung or heart diseases.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ALMOND MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Blanch one cup of almond meats, chop or grind them
coarsely, and pour over them a quart of hot water. Let stand

<h4 class='c016'>STRAWBERRY MILK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Wash two cups of fresh strawberries. Put into a milk-pitcher
and add two quarts of fresh raw or cold boiled milk, a
little vanilla and a small piece of ice. Strain, serve with zwieback
or shredded wheat. Sugar may be added, if desired.
This is more wholesome than ice cream.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COCOA SHELLS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Boil cocoa shells for twenty minutes, then strain. Use as a
substitute for tea or coffee.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TEA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Rinse the teapot with boiling water. Take a teaspoonful of

malt coffee, pour three or four cups of boiling water on it. Let
stand from five to 15 minutes, then strain. Serve hot or cold,
with or without cream. People who wish to leave off coffee
may add a teaspoonful of coffee beans to the cereal coffee
a few minutes before straining. In this way they will gradually
lose the desire for coffee. Bran tea or legume tea may
be substituted for black tea or coffee.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COCOA. No. 1.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve one teaspoonful of cocoa and one of sugar in a

rich milk or one-half cup of cream and water, and boil a few
minutes. Add more cream, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BEAN TEA OR BROTH.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use white, brown or black beans; soak one-half cup of
beans in soft water over night. The next day put on to boil

hot cream to it. Small white and lima beans are excellent
in the summer.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEA AND LENTIL TEA.</h4>

  <h4 class='c016'>NATURAL DIET.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Adopting a natural diet does not mean a return to
savagery. Cracked and flaked grains can be made into delicious
dishes with very little labor and time, <b>and are far
more nutritious than cooked cereals</b>. Sun cooked foods are
rich in vital magnetism, of which artificially cooked foods
have been deprived. They also diminish the desire for tea,
coffee, spices and other artificial stimulants. However, the
change should be made gradually. The best time to begin
is in the spring by partaking of some raw cereal in the form
of a gruel or mush each day. The most unsuitable time is
when tired or overworked. During a vacation is a favorable
time to begin. People who have lived on excess of cooked
and starchy foods for a long time cannot expect to like the
raw foods immediately, it may take several months, or even
a year, to educate the cells of the stomach to act upon them.
Dried sweet fruits (which have been soaked separately) and
sweet cream make good additions if grains cannot be relished
any other way.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the following pages are a number of menus consisting
largely of uncooked foods. Try them. Lay aside your
prejudices against nature, and stop making new and complex
recipes which ruin your health. Simplicity and knowledge
are great helps for a low purse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each person should learn by experience to select the
kinds of food which yield him nourishment and avoid those
which disagree.</p>

<p class='c012'>The most perfect foods, such as apples, tomatoes, wheat, oats, rye,
legumes and nuts seldom disagree with a healthy individual, provided
they are used wisely.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The sandwich is an important part of the bill of fare. It is not
necessary to eat a cooked dinner in order to have a square meal, but for
those who work indoors and are unable to take walking exercises before
or after their noon meal, it is important to take some warm fluid or
semi-fluid food in the form of broth, milk or soup as an entree or with
their meal. With the convenience of modern inventions of gas, alcohol
and electric stoves, or patented bottles which keep food warm for hours,
this is easily obtained.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some people thrive on raw foods, while others do not. The best
time to begin with raw foods is in childhood. Hot house plants cannot
digest raw foods. Open your doors and windows and learn to breathe first.
Fresh air and sunshine are necessary for the change of food. If your
teeth are poor, substitute a food-chopper or grinder for your foods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Use only one rich protein food at any meal. Exceptions: A few
nuts which are rich in fat may be eaten at the end of a meal where
cottage cheese, peas, or eggs are served.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>SANDWICHES.</h4>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'>HONEY SANDWICHES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Spread some stale or sun-dried black or Graham bread with
honey or with butter and honey. Serve with black malt coffee
for supper. A salad consisting of fruits, almond cream and
raw green leaves makes a suitable entree. Whipped cream
may be used instead of butter or almond cream. Among
fruits, apples, prunes, bananas and pineapples are the most
suitable combinations. Honey should be used sparingly
during hot summer days as it is very heating to the blood.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SCRAMBLED EGGS ON SANDWICHES, AND CHERRIES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Eat the cherries at the beginning or at the end of the
meal; lettuce is a good addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GROUND NUTS WITH APPLES AND RAISINS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Grind six to twelve nuts in the morning and keep in a
jar or paper bag. At lunch-time cut one apple into small
pieces, add twelve raisins and the ground nuts. Eat with or
without bread and butter. It is best to use only one kind of
nuts at a time. Celery is also a good addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>NUT AND DATE SANDWICHES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the stones from one-half dozen or more dates,
cut the dates into small pieces and mix with one-third or one-half
the amount of chopped or ground walnuts. Spread on
buttered bread or eat the bread with it. Apples combine well
with it, either as a substitute for bread or in combination with
it. In place of whole nuts, nut-butter may be used; the latter
should always be diluted with an equal amount of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Figs, raisins or dried currants can be used in the same
way as dates. Lettuce and celery are good additions.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOMATOES WITH POPCORN, BREAD AND BUTTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare a salad with tomato and lettuce, or strain some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>canned tomatoes. The latter can be carried conveniently in a
small Mason jar. Always open the jar a little, if left to stand
in a store or office, so the air can circulate through it. Take
one cup of tomato juice in combination with one-half pint or
more of warm, buttered popcorn. Eat bread and butter with
it, if desired.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EGG SANDWICHES WITH WATERCRESS, OLIVES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Slice some hard boiled eggs and lay on buttered bread.
Mix some olives and watercress with mayonnaise dressing,
and serve with the bread. Egg sandwiches combine well with
apples.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GRATED CHEESE, APPLES AND BUTTERED BREAD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Grate two to four ounces of Swiss or American cheese
and carry in a glass jar or paper bag. At lunch-time peel one
or two apples, cut them up in small pieces and mix with
grated cheese. Eat with buttered bread.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COTTAGE OR CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Spread thin slices of rye or black bread with cheese.
Combine with apples or olives, with or without lettuce and
mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CABBAGE SALAD WITH BREAD AND BUTTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Prepare the salad in the morning, mix with mayonnaise
dressing and carry in a glass or jar. Eat the cabbage salad
as an entree or with the sandwiches. Hard boiled eggs are
a good addition.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>POTATO SALAD WITH BLACK BREAD AND BUTTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Serve the salad as an entree. Prepare thin slices of
pumpernickel with butter and combine with hard boiled eggs.
Nuts may be substituted for eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEANUT AND OLIVE SANDWICHES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Remove the pits and cut the olives into small pieces, mix
with diluted peanut butter, and season with lemon. Spread
on rye bread.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><i>HEALTH HINTS.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The house we live in should be constructed for health and comfort,
rather than for style. Sleep by open windows. Night air is as
pure as day air. Protect yourself from dampness by an open fire if
necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do not dress and wash in a cold bath room. Have your wash bowl
in the bed room. Sewer gas from a small pipe in a well ventilated bed
room is not harmful, as it is carried off in the air. Have the stopper
placed in the hole when not in use.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dress by an open fire or in a sunny room. A chill before breakfast
produces indigestion and a desire for unnecessary hot foods. Never
sleep by night lamps or any other artificial light. They are injurious
to the eyes and absorb oxygen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mothers of girls should think it more important to furnish healthful
exercise, wholesome food and restful sleep during the years of budding
womanhood, than to worry about lessons in music and art, or a business
education. All these can be taken up with much greater benefit after
maturity. Arrested development of the organs of reproduction will lay
the foundation for many years of  unhappiness and suffering.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children require
a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow. We cannot force
nature without paying the penalty. At maturity, we reap what has
been sown for us, or what we have sown for ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each individual is a law unto himself. Two different people afflicted
with a disease of the same name may require entirely different treatment.
Human beings cannot be standardized like inert machines.</p>

<p class='c013'>All berries are rich in minerals and feed the brain cells. They
contain traces of protein. Blackberries and huckleberries are rich in
volatile oils and iron, and are of great medicinal value. They are
excellent for the evening meal in the form of gruels and drinks.
The pineapple contains bromaline and is of medicinal value in the
treatment of certain stomach disorders.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don’t use fruits in excess if you lead a very active life. The right
proportion is the key note to maintain balance. Excessive fruits and rest
is a prescription for sickness.</p>

<p class='c013'>If no great hunger is felt at a meal, do not eat nuts or any kind
of foods classed as protein. Neither stuff yourself with liquid foods.
A fast or fruits, or fruit juices are the best under such conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cooked milk is not a natural food, but neither are cooked cereals. A
combination of raw milk, or cream, and cooked cereals will force the
stomach to absorb the milk immediately, while the remainder, poorly
masticated and filled with germs, will tend to produce an acid process
rather than an alkaline. If sugar is added to raw milk and cereals, the
process of intestinal fermentation is complete.</p>

<p class='c013'>Milk which is acid in reaction, or blue in color, is unfit as a food for
children and invalids. If a mother is uncertain as to the quality of
the milk she is feeding her child, she should have it examined by the
city chemist.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many people who find pancakes indigestible will do well to observe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the time when they are most agreeable. If they are made with eggs,
cream, and water, or with rich milk, and properly prepared and combined
with suitable articles, they are generally agreeable to the most sensitive
stomach. People of sedentary habits, or those who do brain work mainly,
should not eat pancakes or muffins for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cheese is one of the most economical and nutritious of foods. To
serve cheese after a dinner is a wasteful extravagance, and dangerous
to health. Cheese combines well with bread, macaroni, potato and other
cereals; raw greens are also a good addition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oranges, Grapefruit, Lemons and Limes belong to the citric acid
group, and are of all the fruits the richest in valuable acids, which in
the process of digestion are converted into salts, rendering the blood more
alkaline.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cranberries, like gooseberries, currants and lemons, are purifying
to the blood and very valuable as a food in malarial districts. Cranberries
combine well with oatmeal and cornmeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Figs and dates have an average of thirty per cent water, are rich in
sugar and contain some protein and saline matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Grapes are a valuable fruit for the table if eaten in the right
proportion with other foods which contain fat and protein. They are
rich in sugar and tartaric acid. As a medicinal fruit they may be
eaten in large quantities by themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>People with digestive troubles should be careful in combining raw
blackberries with other foods. They are rich in protein and may take
the place of part of the meat dish on hot summer days. They should
never be used as a dessert after a heavy meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bitter substance which is contained in the inner skin of the
banana should be scraped off and added to the bulk, as it counteracts
the sweet flavor of the banana and adds to its digestibility. Baked
bananas are not necessary for a healthy stomach.</p>

<p class='c013'>Don’t take drugs for sleeplessness. Tired feeling in the morning
is the results of nerve starvation and auto-intoxication.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rye meal, if ground in an old-fashioned stone mill, contains all the
constituents of the rye. It is used for black bread, also called pumpernickel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Do not eat berries and legumes at the same meal. Apples, carrots,
celery, tomatoes, lettuce, grapes, oranges or lemons are good additions.
Tomatoes and potatoes should not be mixed at the same meal except
in small quantities, and only when a considerable amount of fatty foods
are eaten. Walnuts may be eaten at the end of the meal, where peas
or lentils are served.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soups prepared from legumes, fruits or cereals require an addition
of fat in the form of butter, oil, the yolk of an egg or cream. A soup
of peas, beans, corn or lentils may be prepared from left-over food or
fresh cooked legumes. To one cup of cooked legumes add three to five
cups of hot water, boil or mix well, then strain. They form a perfect
and an economical meal without the addition of other protein foods.
Celery, lettuce, raw apples and crackers with butter are a good addition.
They should be well masticated, and the soup eaten with them very
slowly.</p>

<p class='c013'>For people of a bilious temperament eggs should not be mixed with
milk or sweet foods at the same meal. Tomatoes, tart apples or green
leaves, raw or cooked are anti-bilious foods.</p>

<p class='c013'>For fruit-gelatine use sago, arrowroot, potato-flour or agar agar.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>HYGIENE, ECONOMY AND SANITATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The pantry shelf with its contents is responsible for many
acute diseases and ptomaine poisoning by unhygienic and
careless handling and preservation of foodstuffs.</p>

<p class='c008'>A closet for the preservation of food should be located on
the north or east side of the house if possible. It should
have several long and narrow windows from top to bottom,
so as to allow plenty of air and light. The shelves should be
constructed of wire, zinc or wooden slats, and be removable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Raw fruits and vegetables should never be kept in the same
closet with cooked food. Potatoes, carrots and underground
vegetables should be kept out of doors or in a dry basement.
They may be preserved in a box with dry sand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Onions should not be left in a paper bag; hang them up in
the sun or keep them in a flat box in a dry place. Onions
which have been cut should never be used again for food,
unless the cut side has been preserved in vinegar or oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>All raw foods which have a thick skin have better keeping
qualities than those with a thin skin; therefore, fancy summer
fruits should be eaten while fresh on the same day they were
picked. No more should be bought than can be eaten the
same day, or else they should be preserved by sterilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>Green vegetables should be used fresh if possible, and not
kept longer than three or four days. Never keep them in
the house or pantry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apples or other winter fruits should be kept in a dry store
room out of doors, in the attic or in a dry basement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whites of eggs should not be kept longer than 18 or 24 hours. They
must be preserved in a very cold place and be utilized at the earliest
opportunity. They are like all proteins, more dangerous than starches
if left to ferment, whether the fermentation begins on the pantry shelf
or in the stomach. White of egg can be used in many different ways.
It may be beaten to a froth and served on fruit soups or fruit pies, or
it can be taken in place of broth at the beginning of a meal. Add a
tablespoon of water and a few drops of lemon or orange or apple
or cranberry juice to one white of an egg and beat up with a fork, or
drink without beating. White of egg can also be utilized for bran cakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The white film that often gathers around grapes is a
breeding place for diphtheria germs. Wash thoroughly before
eating all fruits which have been stored in houses or at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the market. Do not prepare more raw food than can be eaten
at one meal. Never allow it to stand after it is cut.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many housekeepers think it important to scald their dishes,
but do not know that it is far more important to sterilize or
reboil cooked foods which have stood on the shelf for 18
to 24 hours and sometimes longer. Such foodstuff is dangerous
long before the process of fermentation can be detected
by the sense of smell or taste.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some foods begin to undergo changes immediately after
cooling; therefore, cooked foods left over, with the exception
of a few, should be reboiled before serving again. Rice or
other cereals should be stirred over the fire for a while and
then baked in the oven until they are thoroughly sterile. The
care of milk has been discussed in the chapter on food. Soups
which are preserved with fat will keep wholesome for several
days without reboiling. Fruits and fruit juices should not
stand longer than 24 hours. Eggs are best preserved in bran
or lime water or on ice if kept for a week or longer.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PRESERVATION OF EGGS FOR THE WINTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Put one layer of common salt or bran one inch deep on the
bottom of a wooden pail or washtub. Then grease the eggs
with paraffin or oil and place them with the small end down,
so that they will not touch the bottom of the tub. Fill with
enough salt to cover the eggs one inch.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PRESERVATION OF EGGS. No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Preserve the eggs with salicylic acid, which can be bought
in the drug store. Follow directions on package.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DISHWASHING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dishwashing is a work which takes up so much time in
every household, that it is a subject which should receive
some attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper who serves a considerable amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>raw food saves much time and strength by relieving herself
of greasy dishes and saucepans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Scrape off the fragments from plates and utensils and prepare
one basin with hot soapsuds and another with rinsing
water of clear hot or cold water. People whose time is valuable
can save much work by placing the dishes from the
draining board upside down on a shelf prepared from wooden
slats, or set them in a wire basket and let them dry without
wiping.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the dishes are not washed immediately after each meal,
place the silverware and knives in a high bowl or quart measure
and let them soak in hot or cold water. Remove all foods
from metallic utensils immediately after the meal is over.
Never allow metallic spoons to stand in fruit sauce, salt or
in any kind of prepared food. Acids dissolve metal and in
this way may produce poisoning.</p>

<p class='c008'>In contagious diseases all dishes should be sterilized. Burn
up all particles of left-over food, put the dishes into a narrow
pail and boil with plenty of water and soda for an hour
or longer.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DISINFECTION OF EXCRETA.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Use solutions of carbolic acid or chloride of lime. Mix
with equal quantities of the excreta and allow it to stand for
several hours before it is disposed of.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WHITEWASH FOR WOODWORK.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Soak one-fourth of a pound of glue in cold water over
night. Dissolve some lime with cold water, add a few handfuls
of salt. Heat the glue until it is dissolved and add to
one bucket of whitewash. This makes a smooth and healthy
paint. Use for rough or smooth woodwork, twice per year
in laundry, basement or cellar or pantry.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c009'>ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF BRAIN AND BODY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The vitality and activity of every organ of the body is
maintained and controlled by mental impulse, which is transmitted
or individualized by the brain, transmitted in the form
of mental impulse through the channels provided by the
nerves. The brain consists of three parts: the cerebrum or
fore brain, the cerebellum or back brain, and the medulla
oblongata.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nervous system consists of two kinds of nervous tissue.
One of these is called the white substance, composed of
nerve filaments, and is found in the trunks and branches of
nerves on the exterior of the spinal cord and in the internal
parts of the brain. The grey substance is composed of granular
matter and ganglionic cells. This forms the external
layer of convolutions of the brain. This substance forms
itself into a double chain of nerve masses or ganglia which
are connected by intervening cords and extends down on
either side of the spinal column. It is also found in the
interior of the spinal cord, the walls of the internal organs
and in various parts of the body, forming large plexuses.
The solar system, also called the abdominal brain, is the
greatest collection of nerve matter in the body outside the
skull. Other collections of sympathetic nerve matter are
found in the chest and pelvic organs.</p>

<p class='c012'>Natural will-power can direct its force wherever it is wanted, be it
for work or rest; it can sustain on bread and water for many days.
Without substance there can be no power. Substantial food, fresh air,
water and natural exercise develop strong bodies and minds.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>The Brain.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The brain is covered by three membranes, called meninges.
One, composed of fibrous substance, forms the lining of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>interior of the skull and extends downward around the spinal
cord. Next to this is a loose meshwork of delicate fibers,
called the arachnoid. The inner membrane rests directly upon
the brain substance which encloses a meshwork of small blood
vessels and lymph channels. At the base of the brain these
blood vessels form a circle, called the circle of “Willis.”
Through it the blood is evenly distributed into the fine microscopical
structures of the brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cerebrum, or fore brain, is divided into two hemispheres,
each of which is further divided into numerous lobes
consisting of grey and white nervous substance and millions
of nerve cells and fine blood vessels. The hemispheric
ganglia are the instruments through which the intellectual
powers manifest themselves. If these instruments have become
imperfect in structure through retarded development by
wrong environment and education, or have been damaged in
any manner by severe shock, violence or disease, the manifestations
of intelligence are affected in a corresponding
degree.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cerebellum also is composed of grey and white matter
and lies at the back part of the base of the skull. It has no
convolutions, but is subdivided by many parallel ridges. The
pons varolii is the bridge of brain matter which unites various
parts of the brain, connecting the cerebrum with the cerebellum
and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum is the seat
of co-ordination, or associating power, through which the
various muscular movements are effected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The medulla oblongata is situated at the top of the spine,
on issuing from the skull it enters the spinal column and then
is known as the spinal cord. Any injury to this part is more
fatal than to any other part of the brain.</p>

<p class='c012'>By natural feeding, overwork is not possible. The body demands
rest when its strength is exhausted. Artificial stimulants are deceivers.
They make a man feel strong when he is weak. They produce artificial
heat and will-power and an abnormal temperature; they lead to overwork,
abnormal development and degenerate brains and bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cranial nerves are twelve in number on each side and
originate in the brain. In addition to these we have thirty
one pair of nerves branching out from the spinal column.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>The spinal nerves also originate in the brain, they converge
at its base and form the spinal cord which passes out of the
skull through an opening called the foramen magnum into
and through the center of the circular spaces in the vertebrae
of the spinal column.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white fibres of the spinal cord consist of collections
of nerve filaments, each of which carries on a special work in
the transmission of nerve impulses to and from the brain.
Each nerve arises from two roots, a motor and a sensory
root. The divisions and sub-divisions from these filaments
form minute plexuses and fine nerve branches which finally
terminate in the muscles, skin and various organs of the body.
Each of these five nerve branches consist of neurons and
dendrites, by which motions and sensations are carried to
and from the brain. These nerve impulses which are carried
to and from the nerve centers by a mysterious energy, resemble
electricity and can be studied much the same as
electrical currents.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>The Sympathetic or Involuntary Nervous System.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The chains of the sympathetic nervous system are connected
by cross branches to the sympathetic nerve ganglia on
either side of the spine. It also connects by cross branches
and nerve plexuses with the central nervous system or white
nerve fibres. While the white nerve fibres, also called the
animal nerves, are largely concerned with the voluntary acts
of the body, the functions of the sympathetic, or vegetative
nerves, are those concerned with the health of the body. They
govern circulation, digestion and elimination, and the repair
which takes place after a tissue is injured. The sympathetic
nerves spread to every part of the body, especially to the vital
organs. An individual who is richly supplied with nervous
matter of this nature has more endurance (or vegetative
force) than one who is not so endowed. While the brain and
body of man wears out from the day’s work and sleep is absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>necessary, the functions of the heart and lungs and
the work of nutrition must go on just the same, but during
this time the sympathetic nerves carry on the vital processes
of the body without interruption. They never sleep.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>CIRCULATION.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The blood is a circulatory fluid and is pumped by the
heart through the arteries to every part of the body. The
arteries are elastic tube-like canals with walls consisting of
fibrous material and are lined by delicate muscular layers.
The arteries in their distribution communicate freely with
one another, dividing and sub-dividing, becoming continually
smaller, until they can no longer be traced by the naked eye.
These smallest branches are called capillaries. It is by means
of them that metabolism becomes possible. The nutriment
of the blood passes  out through their walls into the tissues
and the waste from the tissues passes back into the blood.
These unite forming larger vessels called veins which carry
the waste matter back to the heart and lungs. The color of
the venous blood is dark blue while that of the arteries is
bright red.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>The Lymphatics.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The lymphatic system consists of lacteals, glands and
lymphatic vessels. The lacteals are small vessels originating
in the villi of the small intestine side by side with the blood
vessels. They contain the milk-white fluid called chyle. The
lymphatic vessels, like the arteries and veins, are tubular
canals, lined with delicate muscular layers and membrane.
They unite with each other, gradually forming larger vessels.
In their course they pass through numerous lymphatic glands
and finally unite into two great trunks.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sunlight is a great disinfectant. Dark rooms are a breeding place for
tuberculous germs. Daily out of door exercise in the sunshine will
increase health and reduce the coal bill. Without exercise our food can
be of little benefit to us.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>Absorption.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The alimentary tract with its different departments resembles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>somewhat a manufacturing plant. The first of these
departments is the mouth. When mastication and insalivation
are completed, the food is conveyed by deglutition to the
stomach. Here it is subjected to churning and chemical
changes by the involuntary muscles and the secretion of the
gastric juice. When this is accomplished, the contents pass
into the intestine. Here they mingle with fluids secreted
by the gall bladder and pancreas. Food which has been reduced
to chyme by the stomach is now reduced to chyle or
liquefied food and is absorbed by the lacteals. When the
digested material is absorbed and carried to the liver, the
glands and other blood making organs, the process is called
sanguification. From there the blood is carried to the heart
and lungs to receive oxygen and then it is distributed to the
different organs and tissues of the body. These processes
are directed by the intelligence of the sympathetic nervous
system which therefore governs the nutrition of the central
nervous system, known as the animal nerves. Space is too
limited to go into a discussion of the functional activities of
the different ductless glands and their relation to the tissue
metabolism.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c009'>KNOW THYSELF.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing pages present an outline in the elementary
anatomy and physiology of the brain and nervous system, to
those who are not acquainted with its structure. To all who
are interested in the intelligent care of the body it is of prime
importance to obtain practical knowledge of the principles
underlying the control of the body. The proper development
of the individual is a steady growth. It resembles the unfolding
of a flower, through the partaking of proper food,
water, air and sunshine. A normal human being enjoys
merely being alive. This is Nature’s law. The shortest road
to happiness is to regard the body as the present dwelling-house
of the eternal, and not merely to dream of the possibilities
of becoming perfect in some future state of existence.
Our physiological body constitutes the source from which
the immortal man receives its strength. In order to have
a healthy mind, all the body must work together harmoniously.
The quality and quantity of the fluids must be right,
there must be no leakage, the wires or nerves must lie in perfect
harmony with the structures resting on a perfect foundation.
Only in this way can the oxygen undergo the highest
modification.</p>

<p class='c008'>A seed requires the power of the sunshine in order to
utilize the elements which it takes from the earth, and in the
same sense the spiritual man receives his nutriment from the
spirit through its elementary forces. God gave us these
bodies, and unless we are willing to care for the temple which
our spirit inhabits, we are not worthy of a better body in this
world or in the one beyond. The primary course for most
ailments can be traced back to hereditary weaknesses, developed
through wrong environment, bad habits and improper
feeding. We cannot develop a fashionable disease of typhoid,
small-pox or diphtheria unless our lymphatic glands are storing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>up excessive waste matter produced by continuously overeating
or wrong eating of unclean combinations of foods.
Neither can right eating alone, without right thinking, physical
exercise, fresh air and sunshine, produce health. The air
we breathe is filled with healing power. The water we drink
is from the fountain of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deep philosophy combined with material science and practical
work will lead to the understanding of the divine laws
of nature. An individual who is suffering from a chronic ill
which he is unable to correct by following a physician’s
advice at home, should seek refuge in a sanitarium and be
educated in the divine laws of God or Nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!”—Browning’s
Rabi Ben Ezra.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spirit, also called essence, light, mind, or soul, is dependent
upon matter for its expression. In other words, structure
precedes function.</p>

<p class='c008'>Example: To produce light we need to act upon a
mechanism. As the striking of a match or the pressing of
a button produces light, so the action upon the brain cells
by the ether of the blood produces light or spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pure air and raw vegetables are rich in ether, and therefore
are a necessity for a healthy mind or spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mental exercise or “thought” is necessary to convey the
blood to the cell mechanism. Obstruction of blood vessels,
preventing blood flow, produces death, partially or wholly.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>STIMULANTS—THEIR EFFECT UPON THE BODY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sugar, tobacco, alcohol, and sweetened beverages in the
form of coffee, etc., produce a stimulating effect upon the
sympathetic ganglia near the base of the brain and through
these arouse the emotional nature, exciting the nerves of
sociability, the facial muscles, the sense of sight, the sense of
speech and the nerves controlling the organs of reproduction
and those of muscular action. Excitability of one set of nerve
fibres will always produce a morbid condition upon the
opposites, and these are the finer instincts and sensualities.</p>

<p class='c008'>An individual with a delicate, nervous structure or one
who has bony displacement or contracted tissue in the cervical
region interfering with normal blood flow, would therefore be
more injured by such irritants or stimuli than one whose
structures and functions are working harmoniously. A person
who, in addition to these physical defects, has weak kidneys
and intestinal obstruction interfering with the glycogenic
functions of the liver will suffer far more often in
spite of total abstinence from all such stimulants because he
indulges in foods such as canned, watery cooked fruits in
combination with yeast bread, potatoes and a variety of
cooked foodstuffs which his eliminating organs are not able
to manage, and alcoholic fermentation is the result. The
blood, instead of being a transparent, homogeneous, and
alkaline fluid, resembles in appearance sour milk. The coagulated
constituents of the blood clog the fine capillaries and
infiltrate the structures of the lower body, allowing the watery
contents to circulate in the tissues of the brain and chest,
exciting the nerves and vital organs and producing an undue
pressure upon the glandular secretions of the suprarenal
capsules, tyroid and pituitary body, leading to diabetes or
dropsy. The symptoms of such conditions are similar to
those of chronic alcoholism.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons of the latter class should avoid all artificial stimulants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and use natural stimulants such as sweet fruits and
honey in very moderate quantities (during the winter only),
and never at the morning meal. They should restrict themselves
to a diet of dry natural foods, including a considerable
amount of fats properly combined with acids and raw greens
in the form of salads. In addition to these they may use
legumes in moderate quantities, raw or plain boiled cereals
without sugar, also nuts several times per week. Clabber
milk and cottage cheese are also good. Fresh milk, if agreeable,
should be modified with one-third water and milk sugar
added, heating to 170° F. The heating of the milk to this
point prevents fermentation. During hot summer months
when the skin is active, there is less tendency to fermentation
by such people, and heating of milk, if fresh, is generally unnecessary.
(However, this is not the case with infants or
people who have a tendency to diarrhea.)</p>

<p class='c012'>Artificial sweets, white bread and poisonous beverages develop butterflies
that crave excitement and artificial life. The world is full
of people that are without substance, power or principle. They earn their
living the easiest way they can. Wrong feeding is responsible for such
conditions. Social reformers and humanitarians cannot solve problems
until they have learned how to feed the race.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>The “Dreadnaught”—Stimulant.</b> (Quoted from Dr. Axel Emil Gibson’s
Work.) The ruling stimulant of the world today is not the coffee,
tea, beer nor even whisky—but the innocent-looking, pleasant-tasting,
alluring white powder known as sugar. Its stimulating power is greater
than that of the alcohol, because it is the parent and generator of the
alcohol.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c009'>CONSTIPATION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is one of the most common disorders of civilized people.
The disease may be primary or secondary. The movement
of the bowels normally depends on the amount eaten.
Some people eat such great quantities that two or three
movements are necessary every day in order to carry off the
excess of waste. People of moderate habits who eat dry food
properly combined need not of necessity have a movement
every day in order to maintain health, but such are few. The
fecal discharge, if allowed to remain in the colon longer than
is natural, accumulates in the folds of the colon, and its fluids
are re-absorbed into the circulation while the remainder becomes
hard; part of it continues to adhere to the mucus
membrane and attracts more accumulation until finally the
entire walls of the colon become encrusted with fecal matter.
A physic will not always remove the encrusted matter or even
loosen it; it may give temporary relief by establishing a small
passage way through the accumulation of the colon and some
benefit is felt. Thousands of people suffer from such conditions
for years without being aware of it. Is it any wonder
that men who are thought to be in apparently good health
die of apoplexy, paralysis, consumption, appendicitis or
Bright’s disease? Besides this nearly all diseases of a contagious
nature have their origin in the colon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question is often asked why do these conditions exist?
Take a lesson from the animals who live on natural sun cooked
foods. They masticate their food and obey the call of nature
whenever evacuation is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Constipation may be the result of purely mechanical conditions,
such as want of exercise, tight corsets, drug taking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>paralytic state of the bowels, strictures or adhesions to neighboring
organs from previous inflammations. Under all conditions
it is possible to be greatly benefited by a diet suitable
in quantity and quality to the individual needs and by correct
habits.</p>

<p class='c012'>Raw foods are more nutritious than cooked foods, if they are pure
and fresh and can be digested without difficulty. A change from cooked
to raw foods might produce diarrhoea or constipation. The latter condition
is generally not dangerous. Constipation from cooked foods is
more dangerous.</p>

<p class='c013'>A daily evacuation of the <a id='t140'></a>bowels is not always a sign that the stomach
and intestines are in good working order. The bowels can be forced to
move by eating of too rich foods.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>OBESITY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are several different forms of obesity, due to varied
causes, and each requires a different form of treatment. The
first class suffer from ordinary causes, and can be cured
easily by a diet which is suitable in quantity and quality to
the particular temperament and occupation and by taking
sufficient exercise out of doors. Unless the person is willing
to deny himself those foods which create this unnecessary fat,
disease or heart failure will follow. The stomach and intestines
under the fermentation of sweets, fruits and starches
resemble a yeast jar; the follicles of the mucous membrane
become filled with beer, alcohol, vinegar and all sorts of
irritating acids and paralyze the cells of the secretory glands
of the alimentary tract. As a result of this paralysis, an excessive
amount of ropy, sticky mucus is poured out, and the
patient suffers with lassitude, nervousness, gas and headaches.
Under this condition the circulation grows weak, the
lower limbs are cold, constipation takes place and often the
feet are swollen. If this condition is not relieved by proper
dietetic treatment, the lower end of the stomach closes to
such an extent as to retain the gasses and alcoholic ferments,
thus dilating the stomach to an enormous degree. Later the
lower end of the stomach becomes partially paralysed, the
portal vein of the liver becomes sluggish and the breathing
difficult. As this condition extends farther down to the
junction of the small intestine it paralyzes the structures near
the appendix and causes appendicitis; or it may congest the
intestine extending to the rectum and cause prolapsus or
falling of the intestines. If the vital organs are so strong
that the latter condition does not occur, there is, nevertheless,
a state of starvation, because the muscles are infiltrated by
fat, and the nervous tissues can not receive nutriment. The
whole body becomes finally congested, paralyzed, and feeble,
and mental and physical disease is the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>To those who are fairly well nourished and have no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>organic diseases the following suggestions may be of assistance:
Begin your change of diet with a fast of a day or two.
Take sufficient out of door exercise to bring about a good
circulation. If the heart be weak, take only short walks and
do not expose the shoulders or chest to hot sun light. Use an
umbrella. Drink water between meals according to your
normal desire. Eat two meals a day for a while, taking breakfast
between nine and ten. The menu may be composed of
raw or cooked spinach, celery, string beans, cabbage, onions,
mustard greens, dandelion greens, black olives, lettuce, cucumbers
and tomatoes. Salads with French or mayonnaise
dressing are more beneficial than cooked greens. Serve with
toasted whole wheat or black bread and butter. Dinner
should be taken between three and five and the menu may be
composed of baked apples, or apple sauce, ambrosia, apricot
sauce, plum sauce, stewed prunes, or clabber milk with sweet
sterilized cream and toasted black bread, or of raw fruits such
as berries, apples, peaches, oranges, pineapple, or soaked
French prunes. Serve plain or with cream. The first four
mentioned may be served with lemon and olive oil or mayonnaise
dressing (fats properly combined with acids are not fattening).
Whole wheat toast or nuts may be served in addition.
Later add legumes, eggs and cheese to your diet. For
combinations see recipes. Avoid artificial sweets, white flour
preparations, wrong combinations of food, and excesses of
any kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>People who are confined to mental or indoor work should
take walks and other physical exercise every day in order to
equalize the circulation. Those who do domestic work should
devote some time each day to mental activity and walks out
of doors. People who do not reduce by taking out of door
exercise should remain in bed until 10 A. M. for awhile and
take exercises with the lower limbs in a horizontal position.
The above suggestions are only for conditions where the
powers of digestion and assimilation over balance those of
elimination. The treatment of special conditions should not
be undertaken by the patient alone. The condition that leads
to fatty degeneration is also a forerunner of consumption.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>However, in the latter case the patient has less absorbing
power and only assimilates the irritating acids. The brain
cells and vital organs become gradually paralyzed by this acid
fluid and death follows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Certain persons of enormous vitality produce pseudo tissue,
and develop tumors of various types. The names of the various
diseases are many but the causes that produce them are
few. Different persons with hereditary tendencies to different
constitutional diseases may all trace their ailments to one
great cause, that of wrong eating. Chemical and mechanical
injuries by drugs and accidents are often secondary causes
which help to develop such conditions. People who desire to
undergo drugless methods of treatment, such as fasting, dieting
or exercises should never do so without the direct care of
a physician.</p>

<p class='c012'>Disease is a sin, produced by improper breeding and feeding and
wrong habits. To those who employ physicians I would say: Do not
expect to be relieved by paying the doctor for your sins. Leave your
arguments at home and take faith with you. Do not expect to be relieved
(from ills) in a short time which have been years in the making. If
you are poor and helpless you will receive more assistance from doctors
than from other human beings. If you are not so unfortunate still do
not deceive him. Leave out all shrewdness and business methods. If
you expect honesty, give it first; be willing to pay for the advice which
has taken many years of hard study and work to acquire. If you meet
a dishonest physician, remember that very often he is the product of
dishonest treatment by his patients. Do not therefore lose faith in
humanity, but seek for another, and be willing to follow his advice,
paying for it cheerfully, and you will be happier and healthier.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>PSYCHOTHERAPY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A science applied to diseases which are of a purely mental
origin and which sooner or later will affect the body. All
chronic physical diseases caused by physical injury will in
time become mental. Here material science, with or without
mental treatment, will bring relief. The treatment is not at all
comfortable and (in most cases) a housecleaning process.
The liver is the greatest filter of the body and the most
sensitive organ. Chronic or acute and poisonous secretions
are produced through mental influences, and this in turn
produces mental congestion. Pressure upon nerves produced
by chemical or mechanical injury affecting the liver or other
vital organs will in time produce congestion of the brain. The
latter can be cured by taking away this pressure through applied
physiological chemistry and applied anatomical adjustment.
In severe cases of illness the cure depends to a large
extent on the faithfulness with which the details are carried
out. Some of these seem unimportant to the patient and to
those who know little of the treatment. In any case where
successful results have not been obtained, it has always been
easy to point to faults of commission or omission.</p>

<p class='c008'>An individual who has an analytical turn of mind ever
ready to investigate his methods of treatment after he has
put himself under a doctor’s care makes a cure almost impossible.
The over-development of certain nerve centers and
the mental discipline necessary for relaxing these functions
will retard or oppress the functions and nerve centers of the
sympathetic nervous system, which are needed for control of
repair work. In other words, nerve centers which are abnormally
positive will cause other abnormally negative nerve
centers to exist and prevent these from reaching a normal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>positive state. As a result the body cannot eliminate its waste
matter, and reconstruction is almost impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two-thirds of the inmates of our insane asylums and
prisons might be cured if the proper treatment were applied.
The young under twenty years of age yield much easier to
treatment than older persons. Pseudo psychic healers or those
who deny the existence of a disease do either effect a cure by
faith or else they paralyze certain nerve centers and drive the
disease inwards turning it into phlegma or fat, or else into more
dangerous material such as cancers, insanity or heart failure.
Scientific psychic healers are doing wonderful work by means
of the psychometer in the diagnosis and treatment of psychic
disorders. However, the cause and prevention of the disease
for these unfortunate victims lies deeper. They are the
product of modern and wrong methods of education, stimulated
and forced by artificial feeding. They have reached
that state of refinement, or culture of the flesh, and soul
starvation where degeneration is at work. If the body is the
strongest, the result is mental derangement. If the body is
the weakest, the result is cancer and tuberculosis in its acute
or chronic form, and many other bodily disorders. A healthy
person (even if born with a delicate body) who has been
perfectly fed on natural foods which have not been deprived
of their organic salts could not possibly be affected by slight
shocks of unpleasant environment to such an extent as to
produce diseases either mentally or physically. Sorrow and
disappointments in life are just as necessary for our development
as rainy and unpleasant weather is. The weak brains
and bodies of brittle bone and diseased flesh are the result
of wrong feeding. Chronic food poisoning and starvation is
much more detrimental to the human race than wholesome
natural foods with the addition of small quantities of alcohol.
The person who is boasting of health and old age in spite of
small quantities of whiskey taken is generally born with no
weaknesses. The effects of alcohol have probably shortened
his life of eighty or one hundred years, but his mental and
physical capacities have been superior to that of many intemperate
drinkers as well as eaters.</p>
